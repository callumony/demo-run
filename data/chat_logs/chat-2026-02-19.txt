1. **Basic Website**: $1,000 - $3,000
   - Simple design with minimal custom features.
   - Suitable for small businesses or personal projects.

2. **Standard Website**: $3,000 - $7,000
   - More customization, responsive design, and possibly some additional features like a contact form or basic SEO setup.

3. **Advanced Website**: $7,000 - $15,000+
   - Highly customized design, advanced functionality (like e-commerce capabilities), and extensive SEO or marketing integration.

These prices can be influenced by factors such as:
- The platform used (WordPress, custom-built, etc.)
- The need for branding and graphic design services.
- Ongoing maintenance and support.
- Inclusion of features like content management systems or user accounts.
