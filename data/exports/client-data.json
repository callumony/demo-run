(Is your team more Low, Medium, High? Or perhaps P1, P2, P3, P4? - it's your choice!) \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSort action cards by Priority level in your project's card layouts\\\\n\\\\n# How to get started: Toggle on the Hive App\\\\n \\\\n**Step 1: **Toggle on Card priorities in Hive Apps. Note: A workspace Admin must enable this! \\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: **Check out your new feature: open any action card to see the defaults: High, Medium and Low as shown in the screenshot below.

Action templates can help you quickly update tasks that tend to repeat throughout your projects and keep consistency across the workspace.\\\\n \\\\nAdditionally, these templates can also be automatically applied using forms or project settings for more streamlined workflows.\\\\n\\\\n# To create an action template:\\\\n \\\\nGo to your main menu (upper right corner)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Settings\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Templates\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nMake sure you are in the \\\\\\\"Action Card\\\\\\\" menu\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Create action template\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nName the template and provide a label if desired\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the subactions, assignees, days, and durations. It will look something like the below. You can add further levels of subactions onto your action templates too!\\\\n \\\\nThen you just save the action template and you're done!\\\\n \\\\n You can also create an action template straight from an action card, using the 'Save as template' option underneath the More menu on the right:\\\\n\\\\n# Setting due dates on action templates\\\\n \\\\nTo ensure deadlines are included when you apply an action template, make sure that the 'Automatically add due dates' option is checked. ​\\\\n \\\\n We will refer to the image above for the examples below \\\\n\\\\nAssuming you've used positive and negative deadlines, there are two different scenarios to which deadlines will be applied:\\\\n\\\\n## 1. If your main action card already has a deadline set, at the moment that you apply the action template:\\\\n \\\\nSince you have already applied the deadline to the action, Hive is smart to know that you need to complete the action by that specific date. Hive will set any subaction in your action template that is listed as 'Day 0' as equal** to the parent action due date. \\\\n\\\\nAll negative days will happen before the action due date and all positive days will happen after the action due date, following the same pattern.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the above example for the Blog Post action template, if you have **set** the action card's deadline to 15 Jan **before** applying the template, when you apply the Blog Post action template:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Draft\\\\\\\" will be set for 13 Jan (minus 2 days before 15 Jan) \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Review\\\\\\\" will be set for 14 Jan (minus 1 day before 15 Jan)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Finalize & Post\\\\\\\" will be set for 15 Jan (Day 0)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Analyze Post Traffic\\\\\\\" will be set for 21 Jan (plus 6 days after 15 Jan)\\\\n \\\\n## 2. If your action does not currently have a deadline set when you apply the action template:\\\\n \\\\nSince you have enabled deadlines and your action currently has no deadline, Hive assumes that the subaction marked as 'Day 0' in the action template is today.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the above example for the Blog Post action template, if today is 17 Dec:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Draft\\\\\\\" will be set for 15 Dec (minus 2 days before today)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Review\\\\\\\" will be set for 16 Dec (minus 1 day before today)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Finalize & Post\\\\\\\" will be set for 17 Dec (today)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Analyze Post Traffic\\\\\\\" will be set for 23 Dec (6 days after today)\\\\n\\\\n# Adding dependencies to the template\\\\n \\\\nNot only can you automatically add deadlines, you can also set up dependencies . So if one step can't move forward without the completion of another, it can be useful to set one up. \\\\n\\\\nJust click the \\\\\\\"Add dependency\\\\\\\" link. It will open a search box where you type the name of the step you want this step to be dependent on and select add. It will then show the dependency in bright yellow with the option to remove. \\\\n\\\\n# Adding approval rounds to the template\\\\n \\\\nIf your action will need an approval process, you can include an approval template within your action template. ( Note: you will need to first save the approval template by setting up the approval round and clicking Save as template under the More menu ).\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have the approval template, you can add it to your action template here towards the bottom of the modal.\\\\n\\\\n# Adding an action template to a card\\\\n \\\\nBefore applying an action template, you can also manually create action cards. Navigate to the project workspace, click on the **New (+)** button in the toolbar, and customize your action card for the specific needs of your project.\\\\n \\\\nClick the blue + New button next to the search bar to create a new action card, then select \\\\\\\"Apply Template\\\\\\\" under the More menu towards the right.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the searchable popup, click the name of the template you would like to apply. It will create the subactions and add the assignees, due dates, and dependencies from your template.\\\\n\\\\n# Adding multiple action templates to a card\\\\n \\\\nYou can now layer multiple action templates on a single action card. To do so:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nApply the first action template to the card. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect a second action template from the dropdown list.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHive will add in all of the subactions, due dates, assignees, and attachments from the second action template. All data from the first template will also remain! \\\\n \\\\n# Applying action template to multiple actions at once\\\\n \\\\nIf you want to apply the same template to actions in bulk, you can do it in Table view. All you have to do is to select actions, right-click and select 'Apply action template'. \\\\n \\\\nAlternatively, action templates can be pre-applied to cards using the \\\\\\\"Use action template\\\\\\\" option in project settings. Configure this to automatically apply templates to new cards created via forms, ensuring consistency and saving time.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Action Template — Deadlines New this Week in Hive: June 2021 New This Week in Hive: August 2021 New This Week in Hive: November 2021 New This Week in Hive: December 2021  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 5782\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"project_views\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Project Views & Layouts\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"7 interchangeable views: Status View (Kanban boards), Label View (tag-based grouping), Calendar View (date-based), Gantt View (timeline with dependencies), Table View (spreadsheet-like), Team View (by assignee), List View (filterable list with sections).\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 2,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 13445,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Project Layouts (All 6 Views)\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/511650-project-layouts\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Project layouts | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects Project layouts \\\\n# Project layouts\\\\n \\\\nThe 7 types of layouts and when you should use each\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over a year ago  \\\\nHive offers 7 different ways to view a Hive project and this will give you an overview of each:\\\\n \\\\n Status view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Team view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Calendar \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Label view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Gantt chart \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Table view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n List view \\\\n \\\\nWithin the project, you can toggle between the views at any time** and even have **multiple people in the same project each working in a different layout**. Everyone will see the information and **updates in real-time, no matter which layout** they are in!\\\\n\\\\nEach layout can be helpful depending on what your team is working on and how you like to organize your work.  So how do you know which one to choose?\\\\n\\\\nIn this article, we'll provide guidance on the pros and cons of each layout. So that the next time you make a project you can choose your layout with confidence. \\\\n\\\\n# **1. Status view**\\\\n \\\\n In status view, all of your project's action cards are organized in lists that each represent a \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\" in your workflow. Your actions move horizontally across the lists from unstarted to completed. You can customize the status columns to fit your team's exact specifications. \\\\n\\\\n**When is status view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you prefer a **visual workflow**, status view lets you see at a glance the progress of a project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf the actions in your project **all go through the same statuses**, it makes a lot of sense to use a status view.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your team uses **Agile methods**, status view is best suited to organizing and managing sprints.\\\\n \\\\nThose are just a few of the instances status view can be useful. In terms of downsides, status view doesn't emphasize deadlines as much as other views, and it can be a little more difficult to break it down by team member or label. \\\\n\\\\n**A note on statuses:**\\\\n\\\\nAs mentioned above, actions in status view move horizontally from one list to another. The default set of statuses is unstarted -> in progress -> completed. However, you can add new statuses to completely customize how your project is organized. The easiest way to add a status is to scroll over to the right of your project, add the name of your status in the text box, and press enter.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some examples of sets of statuses that your team could use:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Blog publishing** - unstarted -> ideas -> writing -> editing -> add images -> published -> share on social media -> completed\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Agile sprint** - unstarted -> this week -> in progress -> needs review -> completed\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Hiring funnel **- unstarted -> reviewed application -> selected for phone interview -> phone interview scheduled -> selected for on-site interview -> on-site interview scheduled -> hired -> completed\\\\n\\\\n# **2. Team view**\\\\n \\\\n In team view, all your actions are organized under columns with each list representing a team member.  You can reassign actions to other team members with a simple drag and drop, and add new actions onto someone's list with ease. \\\\n\\\\n**When is team view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIt's great for managers who want an easy way to **assess team workload**.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf actions often move from one person to another, it is super **easy to move actions between team members** in team view.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou can keep from putting too much on people's list by **adding tasks to the unassigned** column. That way the first person to have some free time can pick it up by dragging it onto their list. \\\\n \\\\nThese are just a few reasons of why having a team view can help you move your project forward.\\\\n\\\\nTeam view is not as helpful if you need to see the status of your actions or if you are working on a project by yourself.\\\\n\\\\n# **3. Calendar view**\\\\n \\\\n In calendar view , you can see all the actions in your project organized by deadline. You can simply drag and drop to change an action's deadline. The default view shows all actions due for the next six weeks. \\\\n\\\\n Hive calendar also allows you to **one-way sync **to Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCal. \\\\n\\\\n**When is calendar view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want your team to **focus on deadlines**, a calendar makes it easy to keep them top of mind.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want to be able to **view your actions on your email calendar **as well, this view is the only one that allows you to do that. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want **all the actions you add to have deadlines**, it's super easy to do on the calendar. You can just click the date and it automatically opens a task with that deadline. \\\\n \\\\nCalendar view is awesome! The only cases where it's not as useful are when you want to be able to view key details of your actions on the front of the card. In calendar view, only the title and the assignee of the action shows. It's also harder to see who on your team is working on what for the same reason. \\\\n\\\\n# **4. Label view**\\\\n \\\\n In label view, all your actions are organized under lists with each list representing a different label.  You can change the label of an action with a simple drag and drop, and add new actions to a label with ease. \\\\n\\\\nLabels in Hive are essential tags you can add to action cards that make it easier to distinguish between different actions in a project. \\\\n\\\\n**When is label view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your **team uses several labels**, this layout can be a great way to assess your workflow across initiatives.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want to **easily add labels to new actions **you create, all you have to do is type in an action in the text box of the label you want to add.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your team prefers a **visual workflow**, it helps that each action comes with a color that can make it easier spot the differences between them.\\\\n \\\\nLabel view is not as helpful if your team doesn't really use labels or you want to be able to easily see who is responsible for an action. \\\\n\\\\n# **5. Gantt Chart**\\\\n \\\\n In Gantt, all your actions are laid out in a chart where each line represents something you want to do. These actions correspond to dates where the start and endpoint of the action represents the timeline it is expected to be completed. You can drag and drop to change the timeline and simply click to add a new action.  \\\\n\\\\nGantt charts includes the ability to zoom into to take a closer look and add dependencies when needed.\\\\n\\\\n**When is Gantt Chart helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you are trying to plan out how long a project will take, Gantt is a perfect way to assess that.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you have a clear understanding of the steps involved in completing the goal, it is really easy to lay out in a chart form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you need to be able to share your plan with people outside your organization, Gantt allows you to export your work to PDF, PNG or XLS.\\\\n \\\\nGantt view is so great for planning, but not as useful if you run in an agile framework where you never really can predict specific timelines.\\\\n\\\\n# **6. Table View**\\\\n \\\\n In Table View, all your actions are laid out in a table (like a spreadsheet). These actions can be sorted and filtered accordingly to your needs and preferences. You can easily edit the text or change the fields by clicking on it.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n Additionally, you can use filters on the column titles to filter many of the actions. Columns can be re-arranged or toggled on and off for your preferences. \\\\n\\\\nWhen is Table View useful?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you are to do a multiple sort/filter. Say you want to see all actions that are unstated but overdue, you can do so quickly and flexibly in Table View.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you want to see a list of actions and make changes quickly. In table View, you can edit the field by clicking on it. \\\\n \\\\nTable View is so great for quick editing and filtering. However, it is important to know that first-time users may feel overwhelmed by Table View. Know that a table view is useful when you know exactly what you want. \\\\n\\\\n# **7. List View**\\\\n \\\\nOur newest Project Layout List View brings the convenience of a list (think My Actions View, but for any project) with customizable filters. Think: one expanded list of all actions in your project that can be customized, filtered, and edited to fit your workflow, preferences, and needs.\\\\n\\\\nLike Table View, List View columns with Status, Labels, etc, will all be editable directly from the column themselves. This will allow users to quickly alter or change small task items as needed without going into the action card itself.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive Projects Summary Views Export project plans Share read-only project link Project Creation and Management FAQs  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 8508\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"List View\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/8907936-list-view-a-new-project-view-in-hive\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"List View: A New Project View in Hive | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects List View: A New Project View in Hive \\\\n# List View: A New Project View in Hive\\\\n Written by Michaela Rollings Updated over 4 months ago  \\\\nThis week we're launching List View,** and it's not every day we launch a brand new project view. \\\\n\\\\nWith this new view, we're bringing the convenience of a list into your Hive projects - if you like Home View, this will be your new favorite.\\\\n\\\\nThink: one expanded list of all actions in your project that can be customized, filtered, and edited to fit your workflow, preferences, and needs. \\\\n\\\\n**​\\\\n \\\\nTo access List View and test it out for yourself, just create a new tab with our swanky new tabs feature and select List View. \\\\n\\\\nIf you want this List View to be private, just slide the \\\\\\\"Private view\\\\\\\" toggle on the bottom of the dropdown.\\\\n\\\\nAt the top right, you'll find the Configure view settings:**\\\\n \\\\n Group By section : by default, the List view will be organized by Status, but with a few clicks, you can configure the list view to group by:\\\\n \\\\nStatus\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSection\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPriority Level\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject/subproject\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPhase\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Filter section: provides a variety of different filters such as Statuses, Assignees, Dates, Labels, etc.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Display section: \\\\n \\\\nColumns: One of the ways to select which columns to display.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBlocked actions: Blocked / Unblocked / Show both\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nMilestones: Milestone / No Milestone / Show both\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nArchived actions check box\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProjects in draft mode check box\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEmpty groups check box: if your Section/Project/Status, etc doesn't have any actions under it, you'll want to check this box to allow Hive to show that empty Section/Project/Status in your view.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUnbundle subactions: Do not show subactions unless they're grouped under parent actions\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHide subactions: Do not show subactions when they're not grouped under parent actions\\\\n \\\\nBringing special attention to Sections.

You've found it.\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over a year ago  \\\\nWelcome!  You’ve landed in the right spot to get Hive set up the way you want to work.  \\\\n\\\\nHive takes everything your team needs - quick chat, tasks, projects, and files - and puts them on one dashboard.  Together, with the power of flexible views so you can work the way you want, and predictive data to track upcoming issues, Hive is working just as hard as you are to keep your projects on track.   \\\\n\\\\nThis article will take you through the most important milestones in getting set up, but if you're looking for a quick tutorial - check out this Hive 101 Overview: \\\\n\\\\nReady to go?   Create your Hive account , and get started with the steps below.   ​\\\\n\\\\n# 1. Enter your first tasks\\\\n \\\\nStart by entering a few tasks on your own My Actions list, by using the blue +New ** button in the top right, and enter at least 3 tasks for upcoming work you have to complete. Select a due date and check them out on the **My Actions** tab along the left navigation bar.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen you created those actions, did you notice all the possible details you can add to the action card? We recommend to start simple, but when you're ready - there are some powerful ways to manage tasks:\\\\n\\\\nDon't forget - that blue **+New** button, then select 'Action' is the place to assign actions to your team as well.  **​\\\\n\\\\n# 2. Rally your team\\\\n \\\\nNow it's time to think about who will need access to Hive so that they can be be assigned work, comment and collaborate, attach files, review progress, move projects forward to the next stage, and close them out.  \\\\n\\\\n Add your co-workers. ** For primary members of the workspace who have access to multiple projects - invite them in using email, and selecting which projects they should see - simply using the **+Invite** button next to +New action button:\\\\n\\\\n**Organize everyone.**  If your co-workers are organized into departments or teams, you'll want to add that team structure to Hive so you can more easily add them to projects, and specifically @mention a team in chat groups and comments.  You can find the Teams section from your profile menu (your avatar in the top right), then under Workspace settings choose **Settings **or **Manager users**.  \\\\n\\\\n**Include any external users. ** Collaborate with freelancers or work closely with clients or vendors?  Add them as an external user .   They will have access to a single project, and its associated chat group, if one exists.  Click to that **External User** tab as shown in the above screenshot, to add an External User to one project.  **​\\\\n\\\\n# 3. Start collaborating\\\\n \\\\nNow that you have a few tasks on your own to-do list (My Actions), and invited your colleagues and organized them into teams, let's start entering projects.\\\\n\\\\n Ready to go?****Head to Project Navigator , click +New Project** button, and enter a name.  You'll see options underneath for some optional fields:\\\\n\\\\nDue date -  flag to the team when the project is expected to be completed or launched. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLocation - you can make this project a child or sub to a parent project or just create a project on its own.  We recommend making Parent projects if you have many client projects under the same client, or you have departments, and sub-projects underneath each department in your organization.\\\\n \\\\nOn the next screens you'll pick the layout , and decide on the sharing permissions.  \\\\n\\\\nWith the project created, start collaborating with your team:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDo you have repeatable steps in your workflow?  Set up action templates . \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Post a comment on an action card to keep conversation in context of the task at hand\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n@mention your teammates to call their attention quickly to your question or comment\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCheck your Notifications feed - (look for the bell icon in the top right) - it's your command central for tasks and items that need your attention.  You can always choose when and how you get notified, too.  \\\\n \\\\n**Need inspiration?****What type of work does your team do, and what's your primary goal for using Hive? We power many teams - and have several examples of marketing, product development, software development, human resources, content marketing, and branding/client project setups.  If you haven't already added those project templates during the on-boarding screens, send us a message and let us know what template you're looking for, and our Customer Success team will be in touch.\\\\n\\\\n# Final Steps & Power-Ups:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Get the apps.**  Make sure to download the Hive apps so you can create tasks, respond to comments, and chat to your colleagues on the go, and our desktop apps for Mac or PC.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Setup your integrations.**  Check out our available integrations through Zapier.  \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Join a webinar. ** Sign up for our next webinar \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Ask us anything.  **Use the blue question mark in the top right of the app to reach us, or visit our Help Center for more detailed articles.  \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Personalize it!** Finally, don't forget to add your company logo to Hive\\\\n \\\\n ​ ​\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Staff your projects Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue Hive Best Practices  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 5362\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Understanding Hive's Platform\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/1519397-understanding-hive-s-platform\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Understanding Hive's Platform | Hive Help \\\\n• **    Getting Started Getting to know Hive Understanding Hive's Platform \\\\n# Understanding Hive's Platform\\\\n \\\\n15 seconds introduction to the Hive dashboard\\\\n A Written by Alexander Heldring Updated over 2 weeks ago \\\\nWelcome to the Hive dashboard!

In the right column** you’ll see who is assigned to the action, when it’s due, and what the card’s status is. \\\\n\\\\nIf you'd like the action card to appear as an event in your Google/Outlook Calendar, you can use the 'Schedule time' option under the Dates section in the card. To make the 'Schedule time' option appear, you'll make sure you have Hive Calendar connected in your Hive Apps. \\\\n\\\\nThe pop-out will show your Calendar availability, including existing events and you'll be able to choose a suitable time slot. The event will appear in your Calendar with the same name as the action card title.\\\\n\\\\nTo schedule an event for both you and your teammate/-s, you can add them to the guest list. Hive will then show the full Calendar availability of each team member you add – making it easier than ever before to schedule time for meetings, check-ins, and more!\\\\n\\\\nUse the following options to easily add your event data to the action card as well:\\\\n \\\\nAdd to estimated time - add event time duration to the Estimated time section on the card;\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd users as assignees - set all guests as assignees on the card;\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSet as action due date - use the event date as a new due date for your action card.\\\\n\\\\n**Note**: this feature works for both Google & Outlook Calendars, however, Outlook users can only schedule time for their own calendar, not search for others' availability.\\\\n\\\\nThe** top bar** of the action card tells you which project it’s in, and the bar’s color represents the project color. **Move the card **to a new project by clicking on the caret next to the project’s name. \\\\n\\\\nTo mark your card as **urgent**, access action templates , convert your action, or use other great features, head over to the 'More' menu at the top right of the card.\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that it's possible to change your action's status color. All you need to do is open up the Statuses dropdown and hit the pencil icon next to the Status you want to change the color for.** **\\\\n\\\\n**Note: since this is a global setting, the color will be changed in every action card with that status in your workspace. Keep this in mind when changing common statutes like \\\\\\\"In Progress\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Completed\\\\\\\".**\\\\n\\\\nQuickly share, delete, archive, or add followers to your action from the bottom right of the card. \\\\n\\\\n Following the card means you will get notifications in your activity feed for things like comments, status updates, and date changes. Assignees will automatically become followers. **​ Use the comments section on the bottom left of the card to collaborate with your teammates. When you @mention someone, they will automatically be added as a follower. You can use the @action and @project shortcuts to automatically send a direct mention notification to all action card followers, and all project members, respectively. \\\\n\\\\nTo see the history **of your card, click on the 'Show history' option at the bottom left of the card. ​\\\\n\\\\nFinally, if you would like to adjust the Hive Apps that are visible on your action cards, head to the Edit Project menu (More > Edit Project > Advanced settings) and select which Apps should appear for this project:\\\\n\\\\nNote: the options available will depend on which Hive Apps you have turned on or connected in your workspace.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Create a Jira issue from Hive New This Week in Hive: August 2021 New This Week in Hive: October 2021 New This Week in Hive: November 2021 Adding Holidays & OOO Calendars into Hive  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3868\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Project Navigator\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/592728-project-navigator\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Project Navigator | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects Project Navigator \\\\n# Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\nNavigate between all of your active and archived projects\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 7 months ago  \\\\nProject Navigator makes it easy to view, edit, and access all of the projects you're working on. \\\\n\\\\n## Accessing Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\nTo access the Project Navigator, click the 'Project Navigator' page from the left panel of the app. \\\\n\\\\n## Using Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\nIt will open a panel that shows a list of all the projects you have been added to in Hive. If you're looking for a particular project, you can search for it using the search bar.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to see which projects you're a member of, you should go to My Projects tab. \\\\n\\\\nYou can see certain project information at a glance and control which columns (like the name of each project, the team members involved, the status, start and end dates, budget and project custom fields) are displayed for each project. Use the 'Manage columns' button on the right-hand side of Project Navigator to control these columns. You can also sort the columns to make it easier for you to navigate through your projects.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to filter your projects by a project custom field value, this is something you can do as well. You need to hover over a custom field column and click the Filter icon.

Click it again if you'd like to remove it from the favorites section. \\\\n\\\\n# More Menu\\\\n \\\\nIf you want to drill into a project without navigating away from whatever view you are on, you can use the More Menu. It allows you to:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen a project in a new tab \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUnpin the project from your left sidebar\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nArchive the project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDelete the project.\\\\n \\\\nTo access it, simply hover over the desired app/project, right click on the three dots icon near the project, and choose the needed option.

These are things such as new assignments, @ mentions, or direct chats. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**All **- Updates on actions you are following*\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Mentions** - Updates on notifications where you were @ mentioned\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Archived - **Notifications you archived\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Pinned - **Notifications you pinned for a later use.\\\\n \\\\n*****You become a Follower of an action card (and therefore start receiving notifications on the card) if you: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreate the card\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAre assigned to the card\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAre @ mentioned in the comment section\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nComment on the card\\\\n \\\\nThe goal is to make it easier to find what you need.

If you want to check on work that you are following, then go to All.\\\\n\\\\nSee below for a breakdown of when a notification arrives in All, Me, Mentions, and Archived.\\\\n\\\\n# Reviewing your notifications\\\\n \\\\nWhen you see the orange dot appear on your notifications bell, click it to see what's happened in Hive.\\\\n\\\\n## Read and archive\\\\n \\\\nYou can mark a notification as read, just like you would an email, and return to it later.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also click each item to go to the specific action card or message it references. This way, you can use your notifications as a to-do list of items you need to take action on. \\\\n\\\\nOnce you're ready, you can click \\\\\\\"Archive\\\\\\\" to remove the notification from your list.\\\\n\\\\n## Bulk actions and unarchive\\\\n \\\\nHave a lot of notifications? Click \\\\\\\"Mark all as read\\\\\\\" to bulk read them. Then you can click \\\\\\\"Archive all\\\\\\\" to clear them from your list!\\\\n\\\\nTo go back and review an item you have already marked as read, click the \\\\\\\"Archived\\\\\\\" tab. You can select the \\\\\\\"mark as unread\\\\\\\" icon if you want to move it back to your notifications list.\\\\n\\\\n# Offline notifications\\\\n \\\\nWhen you are offline, notifications will also be pushed to your email and mobile in order for you to stay up to date with the latest changes. Your profile is moved to an 'offline' state when you exit out of the app or if you are inactive for 10 minutes. \\\\n\\\\nTo manage your offline notification settings, go to your profile dropdown > Edit profile > Notification settings. Here you can toggle On/Off both email and mobile offline notifications.\\\\n\\\\nNote: this is also where you can manage banner notifications. If you would rather not receive banner notifications while active in the app, you can always toggle these 'Off' here.  \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Notifications Preferences Instant Messaging Quick-Start Guide I'm not getting Hive Notification Emails Microsoft Office 365 Integration OAuth Scopes  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3316\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Notification Preferences\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/685378-notifications-preferences\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Notifications Preferences\\\\n \\\\nHow to control where and what you want to be notified about\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 11 months ago \\\\nAll notifications in Hive pop up in the bell in the upper right corner of the screen. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, if you want to know what's going on in Hive outside the app, Hive can let you know. \\\\n\\\\n Where can Hive send you notifications?**\\\\n \\\\nDesktop\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nMobile\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEmail\\\\n \\\\n**What can you get notifications about?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUnread messages\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUpdates to actions you follow\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n@mentions\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProofing requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTimesheet reminders\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUpcoming deadlines\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nResource assignments\\\\n \\\\nHive can also send you notifications when you are away from the app.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are logged in and haven't interacted with the app recently, your status will change and Hive will send you email and mobile notifications.

Submitted forms have the option to automatically create an action card in Hive with all the form details. ​ Some great uses for Hive forms can include:\\\\n \\\\ncollecting orders or requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nsubmitting bugs and other issues\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\ngathering structuring information from employees (e.g. contact info)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\ncapturing details for a new project request\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nand much more!\\\\n\\\\n# How to create:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnable \\\\\\\"Forms\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\"Hive Apps\\\\\\\" if it's not already enabled\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Forms\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Create new form\\\\\\\" from the Forms Library page\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nAdd a title and description\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDrag and drop the fields you want to add to the form\\\\n \\\\nThere are multiple different question type options and dynamic fields you can add to a Hive form. \\\\n\\\\nBelow are example questions that can be created using a Hive form:\\\\n\\\\n Checkbox Group  \\\\n\\\\n Date Field \\\\n\\\\n *Users can choose Min Date, Max Date/Min Date and Max Date to configure what dates a user can select from the form, this setting can be found in the edit modal for the Date Field in Forms. \\\\n\\\\n File Upload (can support any type of file) \\\\n\\\\n Header \\\\n\\\\n Paragraph \\\\n\\\\n Radio Group \\\\n\\\\n Text Field (Single or paragraph) \\\\n\\\\n Text Area \\\\n\\\\n Ruler \\\\n\\\\n Multi-text \\\\n\\\\nDepending on which field you choose, you have the option to make it required, add help text, set a max character length, and other customizations.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Add confirmation message**\\\\n \\\\nThis is the message that the person will see after they submit the form.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Set where you want to submit the form **\\\\n\\\\n# **Form Statuses **\\\\n \\\\nTo better control form versions and updates without losing prior submission data, we have three form statuses: **Draft, Published, and Archived.**\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Draft** - This is where you work on designing, editing, or testing a form before it's ready for use.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOnce you've made updates to your form or created a draft of it, selecting \\\\\\\"**Save**\\\\\\\" saves the form and maintains the ** Draft ** state. This means the edits you've made will ** not ** be published.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelecting the \\\\\\\"**Publish**\\\\\\\" button saves the changes and allows the updated form to be displayed for members in the workspace.**​ ​\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll users can see a Draft Form in the Form Library, but it can only be published by the form owner or an Admin.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf a member of your team opens a link to a Draft Form, they will get a message indicating this form is under construction and cannot be submitted.\\\\n\\\\n2. Published**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOnce your form is ready to go live, selecting \\\\\\\"**Publish**\\\\\\\" will both** save and publish **the latest version of the form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll members of your team can see published forms.\\\\n\\\\nCurious how to switch the form from Published back to Draft?**​\\\\n \\\\n As an Admin or form owner, ** you might decide the form needs modifications made in the Draft status. To unpublish the form, navigate to the three dots menu at the top of the screen to Mark it as draft.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Archived**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nArchive/Unarchive options in the form are only available for form owner and Admins. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf a member of your team opens a link to the Archived Form, they will get the same message as above indicating the form is unavailable.\\\\n\\\\n# **Pinning your Form: Individually vs Workspace pinning****\\\\n \\\\nThis allows quick access to forms you use on a day-to-day basis or find yourself frequently using. \\\\n \\\\n If everyone in the workspace does not have the same go-to forms, you can pin a form for yourself only **in your Personal Form Library. Individually pinned forms will sit at the top of the Library and remain in the same position just for you (similar to pinning Notes and Projects).\\\\n\\\\nIf you prefer to pin a form ** for all workspace members, ** you can use 'shortcuts'. When a form shortcut is created, all users can access it via the 'New' dropdown in Hive.\\\\n\\\\n# **Determine where the submitted forms should route**\\\\n \\\\nOnce someone has submitted a form, the data can go to a few places.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n** Hive Action ** - Selecting the 'Create new action from form submission' option will automatically create an action card in Hive in a designated project and assign the action to the person(s) you select. It will look like this:\\\\n \\\\n# Creating Actions Directly Under Specific Sections\\\\n \\\\nTo create an action directly under a specific section in a Hive project when a form is submitted, use the Hive Workflows app. Follow these steps:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Set Up a Workflow**: Open the Hive Workflows app and create a new workflow.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Define the Trigger**: Set the trigger to activate when an action is created in your desired project via a form submission.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Configure the Section Update**: Adjust the workflow settings to automatically update the section of the newly created action, ensuring it is placed under the correct section in your project.\\\\n \\\\nThis setup allows you to organize newly created actions directly under specific project sections, improving project structure and management.\\\\n\\\\n** 1.1. Hive Sub-Action ** - Selecting the 'Create new action from submission' option and choosing a parent action card will automatically create a sub-action card under the parent action card.\\\\n\\\\nThe sub-action will look like this:\\\\n\\\\n1.2.** Create another new action from form submission ** - Selecting the \\\\\\\"Create another new action from form submission\\\\\\\" option will create a separate action in another project/assigned to another user/ etc.**​ Another optional but great way is to use the \\\\\\\"Only create this action IF\\\\\\\" condition and set specific criteria for your form submissions. ​\\\\n\\\\n 2. Project ** - Selecting the 'Create new project submission' option will automatically create a new project each time the form is submitted. On the edit page of each question, you can designate the question selections to be mapped to the new project description and/or project custom fields areas.\\\\n\\\\n** 2.1. Update an existing project from the form submission ** - Selecting this option will make the submission completely update the existing project according to the information entered in the request. On the edit page of each question, you can designate the question selections to be mapped to the exsiting project description and/or project custom fields areas.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNote: Form submissions cannot update the description of an existing action card. Instead, new action cards are generated. Use custom field mappings for better data integration.\\\\n\\\\n For additional settings, open the **\\\\\\\"Settings panel\\\\\\\"** at the bottom of the page. \\\\n \\\\n# Common Use Cases and Best Practices\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Project Organizing**: Use workflows to automatically place tasks in appropriate sections for better team visibility.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Data Structuring**: Leverage custom field mapping to capture key form details precisely where needed in your templates.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Troubleshooting**: Ensure your workflows are correctly triggered by testing with sample form submissions and verifying task placement.\\\\n \\\\nBy following these guidelines, you can maximize the utility of Hive Forms and streamline your project setups.\\\\n\\\\n** Email submitter ** - Selecting the 'Each time a form is submitted, send a copy to the form submitter' option will send an email with all of the entered information to the person who filled out the form.\\\\n\\\\n**​ Require Hive sign-in **- Selecting the 'Require sign-in for form submissions' option will require those submitting the form to sign into Hive in order to submit the form.\\\\n\\\\n** Permission Settings ** - Selecting the 'Only admins and form creator can edit' option restricts editing to the form creator and admins.\\\\n\\\\n# **Preview a form**\\\\n \\\\nThe new Form Builder allows users to preview what Forms will look like when sent externally. At the top of the page, select \\\\\\\"Preview\\\\\\\" to view the Form.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also customize preview settings to ensure correct formatting from different devices (iPhone, Desktop, etc.). Click the computer icon in the top right corner and a list of devices will populate.\\\\n\\\\n# **Sharing the form Externally**\\\\n \\\\nEach form comes with a link that you can share or post on a website. \\\\n\\\\nTo access the link, on the Forms Library page click the 'Copy URL' button to save it to your clipboard where you can then post it where you would like.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a person clicks on the form, they will be taken to a web page that looks something like this.\\\\n\\\\nThere they can fill out and submit their information.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"Form\\\\\\\" feature is definitely an awesome way to get things done!**​ ​\\\\n \\\\n# Internal vs. External form title\\\\n \\\\nTeams often have an internal naming convention for their forms, making it easier for internal teammates to identify and use them, but want to add a clear title for external people filling out the form. So, let's dive into the details! ​ To bridge this communication gap, you can add an External title right under the Internal one. The external title will be visible for form submitters.\\\\n\\\\n# Rich text in the form fields\\\\n \\\\nTo make it easier to highlight important or significant information, we have added the ability to format text in forms by using hotkeys. With this feature, you can now bold, italicize, and underline text within any text field answers. The formatting you apply in the forms will also carry over to Hive to the completed card/project.\\\\n\\\\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to use:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen a form\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd text area / single input / multi-text field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSave the form\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen it to submit\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType some text\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect it and hit Ctrl/Command + B/I/U keys.\\\\n\\\\n# Automatically save form drafts\\\\n \\\\nNow user's entries in the form will no longer disappear even if you leave the form! Here is some information on how the form's draft works!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAny fields filled out in a form are saved automatically when you close the form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you re-open the form in the same browser on the same device, the answers you had previously filled out will still be there.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAttachments will not ** be saved, so if you re-enter the form, the attachment will need to be uploaded again.\\\\n \\\\n# Duplicating Form Questions\\\\n \\\\nUsers will be able to duplicate the question in the form by clicking on the Duplicate button in the Form Editor!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAny Logic that was placed in the question will carry over.\\\\n\\\\n# Enable/disable holidays & weekends\\\\n \\\\nIf you'd like to allow your users to select weekends / holidays when submitting the form or instead, limit them from doing so, you'll use the following guidance:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen editing the form, click on your Date question > Data section > Ensure the setting to \\\\\\\"Include holidays\\\\\\\"/ \\\\\\\"Include weekends\\\\\\\" is checked.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n\\\\na) If your form is creating an action card in a specific project, go to your project settings and ensure the option to \\\\\\\"Allow actions to be assigned on weekends\\\\\\\" is checked.\\\\n \\\\n Note: If your form is creating a project using a project template, you'll check this setting in your project template settings. \\\\n\\\\nb) If your form is creating an action without a project or an entirely new project, you'll go to your Workspace Settings > Project default settings > check the option to \\\\\\\"Allow actions to be assigned on weekends\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n# **Custom Logo for each form**\\\\n \\\\nTo upload a custom logo for each form, use the External Logo option in the General settings. This feature will enable each form to display a distinct logo, providing a personalized visual representation for each user interaction.\\\\n\\\\n# **Viewing & Downloading Form Submissions**\\\\n \\\\nYou can access the Form Submissions page by visiting the main Forms Library and clicking on the Form Stats.**​\\\\n\\\\nThis view allows you to see:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLink to the submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSubmission title\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDate of the submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSubmitted By\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSubmission Type (Action/Project)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nStatus (Action/Project status)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOther columns for all questions within the form and their recorded responses.\\\\n \\\\nFiltering and sorting options for columns are coming soon!\\\\n\\\\nUsers can also download the form submissions from the Submissions page.\\\\n \\\\n *Note - If the Form has a special character, the download will fail.

Review the article here to get you caught up. \\\\n\\\\nHive forms has become even more powerful with the introduction of dynamic fields.\\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Users\\\\n \\\\nDynamic users can automatically assign a member of your team to the action card that is created when a form is submitted. Once a form is submitted, that user is notified that they have been assigned a new action. When editing the field, be sure to click \\\\\\\"Map to action assignee\\\\\\\" to automatically assign the user to the card. \\\\n\\\\nOnly members of the project in which the form is being directed to will be available in the user dropdown list. For example, if I have a form being directed to a shared project only available to myself and another coworker, we are the only two users who will be available for selection in the dropdown. This is to protect project membership and assignment as you are only able to be assigned actions within projects that you are a member of. \\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Projects\\\\n \\\\nDynamic Project Question allows you to map the action card to a selected project or automatically link the action card to a project.\\\\n\\\\nIf the “Map to project” option is selected, the submission will create the action card in the selected project within the Dynamic Project Question.\\\\n\\\\nIf the “Map to linked projects” option is selected, the submission will create the action card in the project selected at the bottom of the form, but the action card will be linked to the chosen project.\\\\n\\\\n *Note - You must make sure the Form owner is part of the project you want to choose since the project you're searching for won't be in the dropdown if the Form owner is not part of the project. \\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Labels\\\\n \\\\nWith dynamic labels, the form submitter can select which label their form relates to. The action is then auto-labeled for the team that receives the request. When editing the field, select \\\\\\\"Map to label\\\\\\\". Then in the 'Available labels' drop-down, choose the labels that will be available for selection in this form.\\\\n\\\\nOnce complete, the user will be able to choose their assignee, project, and label(s) when submitting a form, and those fields will map directly back to Hive. \\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\nYou can also have dynamic custom fields in your form. You can choose between project and action custom fields. \\\\n\\\\nIf you go for action custom fields, don't forget to select 'Map it to action custom field' so that the response automatically fills in the custom field in the resulting action card.\\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Priorities\\\\n \\\\nFinally, you may select the Dynamic Priorities question type, to display a drop-down list of the action card priorities in the workspace to the form submitter. You should map the answer to the priorities field, as shown here:\\\\n\\\\nOn the form, the question appears like this:\\\\n\\\\n# \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Import tasks into Hive Hive Forms Run a modern agency on Hive Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue Recipe Build: Form Submission - Update Action Based on Label  😞 😐 😃 Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3260\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"automation\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Hive Automate & Workflows\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Recipe-based workflow automation using triggers, actions, IF/ELSE conditions, Repeat Actions, datatree/datapills.

Business workflows across cloud and on-premise apps are established through the use of Actions and Triggers, into what we refer to as “Recipes”.\\\\n\\\\nRecipes are automated workflows that can span multiple apps. Each recipe comprises a trigger and one or more actions that can be carried out when the trigger event is picked up.\\\\n\\\\nActions can occur outright, or be triggered by IF conditions, IF/ELSE conditions, Repeat Actions, be made callable by other recipes, and provide error handling. Using these different variables, we can create multi-step workflows utilizing as many different applications as are necessary.\\\\n\\\\nFor example: A new user being invited to your HR program can invite a User to Hive. Then, this can kick off an action template in Hive for the new team member’s onboarding, and then send a message to a Slack group notifying the team of our new team member!\\\\n\\\\nAs we build out these workflows, we will most likely want to carry data from one step to the next. For example, we want the email address of our new team member to be what is used to create the account in Hive. Using the Datatree and Datapills available in Hive Automate, setting this up in your recipe is a simple drag-and-drop process. We cover this more in depth in the article “ How to Create A Recipe ”.\\\\n\\\\nReady to start building your own recipes?

If you had defined the **Since/From** date during testing previously, this date cannot be changed again for this recipe\\\\n \\\\n## \\\\n\\\\n# **Stopping Recipes**\\\\n \\\\nStopping a recipe makes it **inactive**. It will stop picking up trigger events. Recipes have to be stopped to make changes to the recipe, or to rename the recipe.\\\\n\\\\nReal-time triggers powered by webhooks (like those in the Hive connector) will trigger events that occur during the time that the recipe is running. If the recipe was stopped triggers will not be picked up by the recipe during the time of inactivity.\\\\n\\\\nRecipes with trigger intervals will continue where they have left off when a recipe is restarted from a stopped state. For example, if it was stopped on Monday, and started again from Thursday, the recipe will fetch all trigger events since Monday and process them.\\\\n\\\\n ​\\\\n Related Articles What is Hive Automate?

Here are a few use cases we're excited about that are now possible with Hive Automate + Goals: \\\\n\\\\n## If your Goal is Driven by Revenue\\\\n \\\\nWe can connect to your CRM, like Salesforce or Hubspot, or your billing platform, to allow you to automatically update your Goal's current value for metrics like:\\\\n \\\\n$ Target for ARR in Q1\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n$ Target for Pipeline created\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n$ Target for Closed Won Business in a specific month or quarter\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n% of monthly churn in your customer base\\\\n\\\\n## If your Goal is Driven by Lead Volume\\\\n \\\\nSimilarly, we can connect to Hubspot or many other Marketing Automation tools to gather the current number of leads, or leads created over a given period. Measure Goals like: ​\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTotal Leads Created This Month\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLeads Converted This Quarter\\\\n\\\\n## If your Goal is Driven by Customer Sentiment\\\\n \\\\nMeasure and track your NPS, or other customer survey scores by connecting them directly into your Goals. If you're customer-centric, this is a must! Goals like:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOverall NPS this Year\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNPS in a Given Quarter\\\\n\\\\n💪 We're just getting started - let us know which tools power your Goals, and we'll work to add support for it. \\\\n\\\\n# Updating your Goal using Hive Automate\\\\n \\\\nUtilize the Hive Automate feature to automatically update your Goal in Hive. In this example, we will demonstrate how to add a numerical value to your current Goal using a custom field in an action card, triggered upon the completion of the action card.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, we will update our ARR goal by adding the value of the custom field to our overall Goal whenever an action card is completed in a specific project.\\\\n\\\\n1. Create a Goal that tracks numerical value.\\\\n\\\\n2. Create a Custom Field that captures the value of the account.\\\\n \\\\n 3. Create a Hive Automate recipe.\\\\n \\\\n4. Make a Hive Connection in Hive Automate. 5. Set up the recipe to capture when an action card is completed.\\\\n\\\\n6. Retrieve action card information by using the ID.\\\\n \\\\n ​\\\\n \\\\n7. Create a Variable in Hive Automate to capture the custom field value.\\\\n \\\\n a. [Custom Field datapill] is getting all of the custom field in that action card \\\\n \\\\n b. .where(\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"CUSTOM_FIELD_ID\\\\\\\") is grabbing the specific ID of the custom field \\\\n \\\\n If you need help getting the ID of your custom field, please reference our Get Custom Field ID documentation . \\\\n \\\\n c. .pluck('numberValue') is specifically grabbing the integer value of the custom field \\\\n \\\\n d. .join is converting the value from C and converting it from Array to String \\\\n \\\\n e. .to_i is converting the value from D and converting it from String to Integer \\\\n\\\\n8. Retrieve the details of a Goal. ​\\\\n\\\\n9. Create another Variable in Hive Automate that captures the Goal value.\\\\n\\\\n10. Use the Update Goal step to update the value of the Goal with the Action Card Custom Field.\\\\n\\\\nUpon completing an action card, the custom field value associated with the action card will be automatically added to the Goal value.\\\\n\\\\nPlease refer to the attached GIF for a visual demonstration. As you can observe, the Goal initially displayed a value of $46,000. However, upon completing the action card, the value increased to $56,000. This is because the action card’s custom field was set to a value of $10,000.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Link Jira to your Action Card or Project Datapills Recipe Build: Form Submission - Update Action Based on Label How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

You may encounter Lists, Hashes, or Lists of Hashes. Formulas in Hive Automate are whitelisted Ruby methods, and therefore not all Ruby methods are supported.\\\\n\\\\nYou can refer to the syntax and sample uses of these commands by clicking the links below: \\\\n \\\\n Lists (arrays) \\\\n \\\\n Hashes \\\\n \\\\n Lists of hashes \\\\n \\\\n Example list of hashes \\\\n \\\\n first \\\\n \\\\n last \\\\n \\\\n index \\\\n \\\\n where \\\\n \\\\n except \\\\n \\\\n pluck \\\\n \\\\n format_map \\\\n \\\\n join \\\\n \\\\n smart_join \\\\n \\\\n reverse \\\\n \\\\n sum \\\\n \\\\n uniq \\\\n \\\\n flatten \\\\n \\\\n length \\\\n \\\\n max \\\\n \\\\n min \\\\n \\\\n compact \\\\n \\\\n blank? \\\\n \\\\n include? \\\\n \\\\n present? \\\\n \\\\n presence \\\\n \\\\n to_csv \\\\n \\\\n to_json \\\\n \\\\n to_xml \\\\n \\\\n from_xml \\\\n \\\\n encode_www_form \\\\n \\\\n to_param \\\\n \\\\n keys \\\\n\\\\n# Lists (arrays)**\\\\n \\\\nArrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. List indexing starts at 0. Lists and arrays refer to the same data structure.\\\\n \\\\nIn the example below, a list of integers is expressed as:\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list = [100, 101, 102, 103, 104] As lists are ordered, we can use the following formula to get the values. Hive Automate only supports retrieving up to the fifth item using this syntax.\\\\n \\\\n**Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.first\\\\n \\\\n100\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.second\\\\n \\\\n101\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.third\\\\n \\\\n102\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.fourth\\\\n \\\\n103\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.fifth\\\\n \\\\n104\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.last\\\\n \\\\n104\\\\n \\\\nWe can also use indexes to get corresponding values. Remember, indexes start at 0:\\\\n \\\\n**Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[0]\\\\n \\\\n100\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[1]\\\\n \\\\n101\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[2]\\\\n \\\\n102\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[3]\\\\n \\\\n103\\\\n \\\\nLists in Ruby supports negative indexes.\\\\n \\\\n**Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-1]\\\\n \\\\n104\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-2]\\\\n \\\\n103\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-3]\\\\n \\\\n102\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-4]\\\\n \\\\n101\\\\n \\\\nLists also support ranges as indexes.

Click on the empty Trigger step:\\\\n\\\\n## **App:**\\\\n \\\\nA new panel will open on the right side of your screen asking you to choose an app. Search for Hive and select the Hive connector:\\\\n\\\\n## **Connection:**\\\\n \\\\nIt will then ask you to select your connection for the selected app. Choose the connection you want to use:\\\\n\\\\nIf you don’t have a Hive connection setup you can refer to the following article: Setting up your Hive connection \\\\n\\\\n## **Setup:**\\\\n \\\\nFor this guide we will focus on the trigger event New Action. If our form is set up to create a new action card then all of the information mapped from the form is added to the card on creation. That means we can use all of that information to create automations in Hive Automate.\\\\n\\\\nHere in the setup we have a decision to make. How do we want the recipe to know which new cards in our workspace should be affected by this recipe? There are many ways to do this but we recommend the following two options as they are the easiest to set up.\\\\n\\\\n**Option 1: New actions in specific project**\\\\n\\\\nIn the setup of the trigger you can simply pick the specific project you would like this recipe to listen to. This configuration above will tell the recipe that it should listen for all new action cards created in the project selected in that drop down menu.\\\\n\\\\n**Option 2: New actions in any project**\\\\n\\\\nThe second option would be to set up a trigger condition based on some attribute of the new action card instead of a specific project. In the configuration of your form there is the ability to map the Form Name to the title of the submitted card. If you have selected that option you can have the trigger listen for if the title of the new action contains a specific string. You would configure the Value above to match the name of your Hive Form.\\\\n\\\\nYou could of course do a combination of both options listed above, so that you only listen for actions in a specific project, that also have a specific form name in the title. You can add conditions as well if you would like to narrow the trigger down further for more advanced requirements.\\\\n\\\\nLast step here is we want to add the following conditional:\\\\n\\\\nThis conditional just ensures that we are only listening to parent action cards. If you are applying a template in the form that includes subactions it would cause the recipe to run when it saw all those new subactions created as well. \\\\n\\\\n## Actions:\\\\n \\\\nNow that the trigger is configured to listen for a specific event, we need to tell the recipe what actions in the workflow we want to happen. Click the + button under the word Actions and let's take a look at our options for creating actions:\\\\n\\\\nHere we have a few options of what we can do with our workflow. The first four listed are the most commonly used:\\\\n \\\\nAction in an app: Take a step to do something in one of the connectors.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIF condition: Add a section to the recipe that only will occur if the condition is satisfied.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIF/ELSE condition: Add two sections to the recipe where only the top section will occur if the condition is satisfied, and only the bottom if the condition is not satisfied.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRepeat action: Add a section to the recipe that will loop through a list of items.\\\\n\\\\n## **IF Condition:**\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow we are trying to implement does require that we take another Action in an app, but we don’t know what action to take yet. Let's start with the IF condition, to make sure we change the right thing, on the right Hive action card. Click IF condition.\\\\n\\\\nYour recipe will now have 2 new action steps. The parent step is for setting up the conditional, and the child step is blank for you to choose what to do inside the IF conditional. We can check for all kinds of attributes that the new action card has. Some ideas would be: Title, description, due-date, assignee, created by, custom fields, or labels. \\\\n\\\\nFor this guide we are going to look at labels. Label data on an action card is given as a list of Label IDs. We can use this list to check if it contains a specific Label ID. Essentially saying if the new action card has a specific label on it, then the IF condition is true:\\\\n\\\\n## **Hive - Update Action:**\\\\n\\\\nThis step in the recipe is nested inside the IF condition from above so that it will only run if the condition was true. We are going to go ahead and click action step 3 and select Hive as our connector again. Then select Update record:\\\\n\\\\nOnce the action is selected you will be brought to the setup tab. The two mandatory fields here are the type of Object, and then the ID for that object. For this workflow we want to update the Hive action card that triggered the recipe, so we pick Action as our object, and then pass the data pill ID from step 1 into the Action ID we want to edit:\\\\n\\\\nNow the recipe knows what record to update inside the IF condition. From here you can select any changes to that Hive action card that you would like. This is essentially where you are creating the mapping in the recipe. For the specific label, what changes are you looking to automatically apply? The most common fields to change would be the Assignee or the Project you want this action card to go to. Simply pick the values from the following drop downs that you would like. If you want to see a full list of fields available to edit you can click on the optional fields button at the bottom:\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations! You now have one mapping completely set up. How do we go about configuring other mappings? Hive Automate has a copy and paste feature that can make the subsequent mappings go much faster:\\\\n\\\\nSimply hover your mouse to the right of the Action step you wish to copy. Click the three horizontal dots, and click Copy. If you copy a conditional bucket it will automatically copy everything inside it as well.\\\\n\\\\nOnce copied you can then paste the selection. Hover your mouse around the area of your recipe where you want to paste the copied step(s):\\\\n\\\\nClick the paste button shown above and a copy of the IF section will appear. From here all you need to do is change the Label ID inside the condition step, and change the update action in Hive step to map the correct Assignee, Project, or any other fields you might have set up. You can continue the copy/paste process until all of the logic you want is complete.\\\\n\\\\nWe always recommend testing your recipes before starting them by hitting the Test button in the top right corner. This will turn the recipe on for one submission to test functionality. Simply hit the test button and submit a form to make sure it functions as you intended.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you are finished remember to Save your recipe and hit Exit. Back on the main recipe page you can now Start your recipe and Hive Automate will handle all future submissions that meet the trigger criteria.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Everything about Labels Creating your First Recipe Testing Recipes Starting & Stopping Recipes Slack/Teams: Messages  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 8622\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"proofing\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Proofing & Approvals\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"File review with annotations, approval routing (internal + external), templates, video proofing, concurrent reviews, approval reporting, and proofing tool with measurement/markup capabilities.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 4,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 29876,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Proofing & Approvals\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/2931726-simple-integrated-proofing-approvals\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Simple, integrated Proofing & Approvals | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Proofing & Approvals Simple, integrated Proofing & Approvals \\\\n# Simple, integrated Proofing & Approvals\\\\n \\\\nFaster turnaround, fewer approval rounds and easier tracking of who approved and when using Hive Proofing and Approvals\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 4 months ago  \\\\n Start by turning on Proofing & Approvals in the Apps page. **\\\\n\\\\nGo to the Apps page in Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnsure that the **Proofing& Approvals** app is turned on.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf the approval section still doesn’t show up in the action card:\\\\n \\\\nCheck the project's settings to ensure the proofing app is enabled in the \\\\\\\"**Apps that appear in action cards**\\\\\\\" dropdown.\\\\n\\\\n Note!

Attach a file to be reviewed\\\\n\\\\nYou can add a file to be proofed by your team from within an action card.  Click **Add proof** to add a new draft of the file you are working on. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also drag the file to the Approval app! (See GIF)\\\\n \\\\nNote: You can attach video files to be proofed as well.  See the full list of supported file types at the bottom of this article.  **​\\\\n\\\\n## 2. Set up an approval round\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have uploaded a new proof, you are ready to route it to the appropriate person for approval. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick Request approval** to initiate the process from the action card.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick **Add approver **to add the appropriate approver to the workflow. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou can add an optional due date to the approval process to provide clarity to your team mates. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor more complex approvals, **Add multiple stages** to the approval process. \\\\n \\\\nOnce the route is set up, click the Request approval button again to make the approval route live and to trigger a notification for the first approver(s).  \\\\n\\\\n**Request Review from a Team**: You can send a request to an entire team by adding the 'team' as an approver. Once requested, a notification will be sent to all members of the team. Users can then choose to 'Review for team' to mark a decision on behalf of the other team members. Once a decision has been made, the team will be notified and the approval request will be removed from the remaining users' queues. \\\\n\\\\n**Add External Approver: **Choose** Add external approver** if you would like to request approval from someone who is not in Hive. Simply enter their email address, and they will receive a link from Hive to review the content in the proofing window. You must add a proof to use this feature. \\\\n\\\\n**Add Form Submitter as an Approver**: if the action was created from the form and has a proof added, you can also easily add the form submitter as an approver with one click. No need to look for the submitter's name, Hive will do that for you in a matter of seconds!\\\\n\\\\n**Change status after approval: **Choose** change status after approval **to automate your approvals workflow by moving the action card to the appropriate status once a decision has been made. \\\\n\\\\n## 3. Access your approval tasks from My actions\\\\n \\\\nIf an assignment has been routed to you for your approval, it will be shown separately from your standard actions at the top of the My actions view. Click the item to begin the approval process.**​\\\\n\\\\n## 4. Access your approval tasks from a notification\\\\n \\\\nWhen you are asked to approve something, you will also see a notification alert on the Notification Center icon.

When opening a video, click the chat icon in the bottom right corner to open up the proofing tool. \\\\n\\\\nTo add a new comment, click New** in the top left corner. Your comment will be timestamped at the time you clicked the 'New' button. **​ You can call attention to a specific area of the video by using your cursor to select/highlight. \\\\n\\\\nTo add a comment click ' Continue**' and then '**Save**.'**​\\\\n\\\\nTo comment on a segment of the video, click and drag the comment bar on the video scrubber:\\\\n\\\\nTo view a comment, hover over the icon on the video scrubber. Click on a comment to jump to that time in the video and add a reply if needed. \\\\n\\\\nTo exit out of the video proofing tool, click 'Esc'. \\\\n\\\\nBack in the action card, you can also download a PDF of all comments left on a video proof by clicking \\\\\\\"Download comments\\\\\\\" just below the video.\\\\n\\\\n**Please note, you'll only be able to download the video comments if it is the most recently uploaded file.\\\\n\\\\n## 7. Mark your decision on a proof\\\\n \\\\nWhen you are ready to begin your review, click the 'Review' button which will update the text next to your name to be 'Reviewing' in order to let your team members know that you have begun your review. \\\\n\\\\nYou can make a decision for the proof you have been routed for approval from the action card for your approval assignment:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick Approve** if no changes are required on the proof. If there is another approver in the route, they will receive a notification the proof is ready to be reviewed.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick **Approve with changes** if changes are required on the proof but it's been approved. If there is another approver in the route, they will receive a notification the proof is ready to be reviewed.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick **Require changes** if updates need to be made to the file you are reviewing. \\\\n \\\\nPro Tip: You can also mark your decision within the proof itself by selecting the green check mark for approve and the red button for require changes. See Section 5. \\\\n\\\\n## 8. Edit a live approval round\\\\n \\\\nIf you initiated the approval round, you are able to edit the route even after it is live. To do so hover over the stage name header and click 'Edit Stage' on the right\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Delete stage** by clicking on the trash can if you no longer need approval from a specific individual. The trash can will appear when you mouse over the stage name header.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Add approver** in an existing stage\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Replace yourself **in an approval round by clicking on your name and choosing someone to take your place\\\\n \\\\n## 9. Mark comments within the proof as Accepted/Rejected and edit existing comments\\\\n \\\\nOnce a colleague has reviewed a file and entered their comments, you may frequently like to decide which comments should be addressed and which do not need updating.  Now, with a comment status within the proofing tool, you can mark each one with the following statuses: Accepted, Rejected, Cancelled, Completed.\\\\n\\\\nJust click the 3 dots on the right of the comment as shown here:**​\\\\n\\\\n## You can also now edit the existing comment from the same menu! ​ ​1 0. Add stamps to files in proofing**\\\\n \\\\nWith a new library of stamps available, you can easily and clearly mark certain conditions for your teammates.  See what's possible here:\\\\n\\\\n## **​ 11. Route an approval round to a team**\\\\n\\\\nDo you often need to send an approval round to a team of people and let them decide who can pick it up? Now you can! As long as the team is added to the project, they will now appear in the drop-down to route a file:\\\\n\\\\n## **12. Proof URL links**\\\\n \\\\nUsers can click the Add proof button and click the '**Link**' option to upload a URL as proof. This will allow you to enter the desired URL and specify if you'd like it to be displayed as a Live Website, Page Snapshot or a Hyperlink. \\\\n\\\\n## **13. **Combine multiple files into one document for proofing\\\\n \\\\nWhen a user uploads multiple files at once, users have three choices:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nUpload as a combined file\\\\n \\\\nChoosing this option will combine those files into 1 long file and convert them to a single PDF file\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nUpload individual files as subactions\\\\n \\\\nEach file will create its own subaction and they will inherit the title of the files. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nUpload as folder\\\\n \\\\nAllows to request approval on all uploaded files as a single folder.\\\\n \\\\nSelecting this option will open a table of all assets with the Approval status next to each. As a reviewer, you can stamp each individual file or all of them as a folder.\\\\n \\\\n**Note**: When rejecting one of the files, you must still approve or request changes on the entire folder.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nYou can delete the folder by going to the three-dots menu at the top of your folder:\\\\n\\\\n## **14. Lock a proof**\\\\n \\\\nOnce all comments and feedback have been added, you can lock your proof. All admins as well as the user who uploaded the proof are able to lock it. To do it, you need to click \\\\\\\"Lock proof\\\\\\\" on the bottom right-hand corner of the image.\\\\n\\\\n## **15. Lock a round**\\\\n \\\\nThe Admins and the Project Owner can decide to lock the Round once it gets completed.\\\\n \\\\nTo do it, you'll need to enable \\\\\\\" Lock proofing rounds once complete \\\\\\\" under Approval rounds.\\\\n\\\\n## **16. Reset a round**\\\\n \\\\nIf a mistake is made in a round flow, you can easily reset a round. It will clear the previous approvals and start the round again.\\\\n\\\\n# Supported file types\\\\n \\\\nThe following file types are supported in proofing:**​ Documents .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xslx, .pptx, .rtf, .odt, .ods, .odp\\\\n\\\\n Images .bmp, .wmf, .emf, .hdp, .jpg, .jp2, .jpc, .png, .tif, .tiff\\\\n\\\\n Videos .mp4, .ogg, .webm\\\\n\\\\n Other \\\\n \\\\n.xps, .oxps, .xml, .xod, .\\\\n\\\\n# Troubleshooting Common Approval Issues\\\\n \\\\n## Why Do the Approval Buttons Disappear for a File?\\\\n \\\\nApproval buttons may disappear after a file has been approved. This behavior occurs because the proof is already approved, disabling the buttons as no further approval actions are required.\\\\n\\\\n## Why Are Approvals Not Visible in the 'My Approvals' Tab?\\\\n \\\\nThe 'My Approvals' tab may not display requests due to filtering settings. For example, if the action card with an approval request has been marked as completed, it may be filtered out:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen the Filters section of the 'My Approvals' tab.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnable the Completed** filter to include completed approvals in the view.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Proofing and approvals with external approvers Approvals Reporting Proofing and Proofing Tool FAQs Approval Routing FAQ Hive for Adobe Creative Cloud  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 12211\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Approval Templates\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4532667-approval-templates\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Approval Templates | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Proofing & Approvals Approval Templates \\\\n# Approval Templates\\\\n \\\\nHive can templatize specific approval workflows that dictate how work should be approved every time to save time & ensure standardization.\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over a year ago  \\\\n## Saving a workflow as a template\\\\n \\\\nTo begin, you'll need to add at least one stage and an approver to the workflow.

To do it, you need to click \\\\\\\"Lock proof\\\\\\\" on the bottom right-hand corner of the image.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is it possible to lock a Round?**\\\\n \\\\nYes, the Admins and the Project Owner can decide to lock the Round once it gets completed.\\\\n \\\\nTo do it, you'll need to enable \\\\\\\" Lock proofing rounds once complete \\\\\\\" under Approval rounds.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the Round is locked, the user will not be able to:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDelete round\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nApply template\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChange \\\\\\\"Move to next stage when\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# ** Navigating in Hive’s Proofing Tool **\\\\n \\\\n## **Can you change the location of the Comments Panel? Can I see the Page Thumbnail Panel and Comments Panel at the same time?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Comments Panel is locked on the right-hand side and will capture the name of the user and timestamp of when their comment was added.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can see thumbnails and comments at the same time by opening the Thumbnails icon on the left-hand side of the tooling tool.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can we attach files to the pdf to reference something?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you may. Use the paperclip icon under the 'Insert' tab on the top bar.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Pro Tip:** Once you click the paperclip icon, then click on the proof to designate the location on the proof where you want the file to be located. \\\\n\\\\n## **If you close out of the files, does it automatically save your markups?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen adding a comment on the file (eg., shape), it is automatically saved. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you add or edit the text in the comment from the Comments Panel, you need to click on **Save** for this comment. This also applies to replies to comments made from the Comments Panel.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can I search for text on image files?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou are able to search for text within the file from the search bar at the top right corner. Image search is dependent on the image type (live text vs. flattened file).\\\\n\\\\n## **Can I compare proof versions side-by-side?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick in the '+' icon on the upper right-hand side of the proofing tool, Then you'll be able to select which file from those uploaded to the action card you'd like to compare. You can compare up to 3 files side by side\\\\n\\\\n## **When you compare documents can you view them on 2 separate screens?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCurrently, when comparing proof versions they aren’t able to open in separate screens. However, Hive can be opened in different tabs of the web browser and then moved to the 2 different screens.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can the old version appear on the left side, and the new one on the right side?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, this is possible when comparing proof versions by selecting in the file dropdown on the left side the old version, opening the File Compare tool and selecting the new version for the proof viewed on the right side.\\\\n\\\\n**What does the 'Show Callouts' button mean?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis button allows the callout comment style (i.e., the box and arrow style annotation) to be displayed on the proof and comments panel or not. All callouts in the proof will not appear on the proof or in the comments panel when unchecked.\\\\n\\\\n**​\\\\n \\\\n## Can you use keyboard shortcuts in the Proofing Tool?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAbsolutely! There are a lot of shortcuts you can use to manage comments and open comment tools\\\\n\\\\n# ** Commenting and Reviewing in the Hive Proofing Tool **\\\\n \\\\n**How do I add comments, annotations, markups to a document in the Hive Proofing Tool?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUse the Annotation, Shapes, Insert, and Measure tabs to view the available comment types. Select which one you'd like to you and then where on the proof you want to apply the annotation.\\\\n \\\\n## **What is the easiest way to delete a comment?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe easiest way to delete a comment is to select the comment and click on the trash can icon under it on the proof. This action deletes the comments from the proof and the Comments Panel. Or on select the comment in the comments panel and click on the three dots icon to open the dropdown to see the delete comment option.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo bulk delete comments in a certain file area, you can also use the Eraser Tool.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you move/delete multiple comments at the same time?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can select multiple comments at the same time maintaining the CONTROL key and clicking on the relevant comments, and: (1) Press the DELETE key to delete all the selected comments, (2) Drag them to move their location at the same time\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you edit your markups after you’ve saved them but, before you’ve completed your review?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you may edit and delete your own markups. Remember to select **Save** after making edits.\\\\n\\\\n## **Are previous reviewers’ comments locked so they cannot be accidentally deleted?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNo, Hive is a very collaborative tool allowing prior comments and markups can be deleted or edited by other team members. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA best practice would be to instruct users not to delete comments, but add a reply or apply a status such as “Canceled” if the comment no longer applies.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you group multiple comments? Can you apply one comment to all the selections?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can select multiple comments at the same time maintaining the CONTROL key and clicking on the relevant comments. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen doing so the Group option (button with the circle with 3 dots) will appear to group the selected comments. If comments are grouped, these will appear under one single comment in the Comments Panel, with the copy of the one selected first.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you change (and save) the thickness/opacity of the freehand and shape tools?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can change these. There is a drop-down menu on the markup tools, and your last selection in terms of color, thickness, opacity is remembered the next time you open the proofing tool. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOr after a comment has already been applied, highlight it on the proof and select the painter's palette icon (style guide) that allows you to update the color, border, and fill of select annotations.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you set a default color for text highlights? When a color is set, is it for all the tools?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen selecting a color for one of the comment tools, this setting will be saved for you in the Proofing Tool across all the proofs. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou can set one color for each type of comment tool. \\\\n\\\\n## **Does Hive have an insert text tool? What about strikethrough and replace? **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nInsert text and strikethrough tools are available. The replace tool is not yet available in Hive’s proofing tool, but the strikethrough tool may be used for this purpose by adding the new copy in the comment.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you draw a straight line in Hive?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, once you select the line tool, it is applied by pressing down and dragging to create the line.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can we create custom stamps?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Hive proofing tool includes a library of existing stamps under the ‘Insert’ tab where there is also the option to add a ‘custom’ stamp displaying the user’s name, time stamp, and/or custom text.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is it possible to turn on a ruler and drag a guide over to measure?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Measurement Tools are available under the Measure tab and can be used to measure and serve as a ruler. For alignment purposes, you can use the Line Tool.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you sort comments by name?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can use the Sort by' option on the right side of the comments panel to sort the comments by Author.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn addition to Author, you can also sort the comments by Position (i.e., position on the proof pages), Time, Status, or Type.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn the MP4 proof, you can also sort by Created Date, Modified Date, Status, Author, Type, Color, Frame, and Timecode.\\\\n\\\\n## **If reviewing comments, can we apply statuses for each? **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, click on the comment in the comments panel. The statuses can be applied, for the status icon to the right-hand side of the commenter’s name.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nComments can then be sorted by status in the ‘Sort By’ option or filtered on status using the ‘Search Comments’ box.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is there an undo function, for example, if I delete a comment by mistake?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can undo any action (eg., add/delete comment) by pressing CONTROL + Z or using the back arrow to the right of the annotations icons. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou can undo as many as you need as long as you don’t close out the proof.\\\\n\\\\n## **Do I need to download and re-upload a proof when reviewing a file?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNo, you can perform your review directly in Hive’s proofing tool by clicking on the file visual on the action card to open the file in the proofing tool. The proofing tool is online, so you can add your comments directly in the file.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is there an option to auto-compare?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe auto-compare option is currently not available in Hive’s Proofing tool.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you import comments from one version to another?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you may transfer all callouts (the box and arrow style annotation), select comments, or all comments to a new version of the proof.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo do so, Open the file you would like to copy them into first, then use the '+' button on the upper right side to add the file with the comments so the proof versions are side-by-side. Next, click the arrow button for transfer comments.\\\\n\\\\n## **If I need to add or remove a page of my proof but still need to transfer over comments, how could I do this?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFirst transfer over the comments from the older version to the file that will be the new version before a page is added or removed. The page numbers need to match in order for the comments to transfer over cleanly. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThen, once the comments are transferred over you can add or remove pages to that file to create the new version. \\\\n\\\\n## **Curious about how to share a link to the Proofing review session with your external stakeholders? **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn the proofing window, find the Share button for your proof.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nCheck out the proof Access type:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Restricted**: allows you to send the proof to a certain email address. Specify the email address in the Invite field and the external stakeholder will receive an email to view the proof.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Anyone** **with the link:** allows anyone to view/comment on the proof. Simply copy the share link and send it out to your external stakeholders. \\\\n\\\\nOn their end, they'll be able to see the following: ​\\\\n \\\\n ​\\\\n \\\\nIf you need your stakeholder to approve the shared proof, add them to the Approval round as an external approver with their email address: ​\\\\n \\\\n ​\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Integrate your file storage with Hive Simple, integrated Proofing & Approvals Proofing and approvals with external approvers Approval Routing FAQ Hive for Adobe Creative Cloud  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 12417\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"time_tracking\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Time Tracking & Timesheets\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Track time on action cards, submit timesheets for approval (3 fill methods), timesheet reporting grouped by project or individual, and export capabilities.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 3,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 11080,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Submitting Timesheets\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/3619890-submitting-your-timesheet\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Submitting your Timesheet\\\\n \\\\nWith the Hive Timesheets application, users can submit time against their projects to be reviewed by their manager or the project owner.\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 5 months ago  \\\\nStart by enabling Timesheets in Hive Apps, by clicking on Apps shown here!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\"Timesheets\\\\\\\" can be toggled on by workspace admins.

This allows you to get a bird's eye view of individuals' time and project spending.\\\\n\\\\nNote: If a timesheet is pending approval or is rejected, the hours will not be incorporated into Timesheet Reporting.\\\\n\\\\n## To open the timesheet reporting\\\\n \\\\nGo to the Timesheets app ('Time'). Workspace admins can enable Timesheets in Hive Apps if not already enabled.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on the clipboard icon on the upper right-hand side and select the \\\\\\\"Reporting\\\\\\\" option:\\\\n\\\\n## Configuring reports\\\\n \\\\nWithin Timesheet Reporting, you can adjust how the data is grouped (by week, month, year) and filter date ranges to pull in data within a specific time period. To select what data is viewable, you can select various \\\\\\\"Display\\\\\\\" options. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also export the data for further analysis.\\\\n\\\\nBy default, the data is rolled up by project for easier billing to clients. To roll-up time by individuals, for easier team management, click the \\\\\\\"switch\\\\\\\" button.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, you can filter the data using the 'Filters' option to filter by project, project tags, custom fields, users, teams, roles, labels, timesheet categories, and Timesheet status. ​\\\\n \\\\n# Reporting Data\\\\n \\\\n## Hours\\\\n \\\\n Calculation: Sum of hours submitted for a project/person This is the total amount of time submitted for a project or person. \\\\n\\\\nExample: A user submits 40 hours of work every week for 4 weeks of a month to Project A. Their \\\\\\\"Hours\\\\\\\" for the month will appear as 160. ​\\\\n\\\\n## Billable\\\\n \\\\n Calculation: # of hours submitted x bill rate This is the dollar equivalent of the time submitted. It is often used as the amount at which a client is billed for the hours spent on their project.\\\\n\\\\nExample: A user's bill rate is $100/hour. They submit 10 hours of work to Project A for the week. Their \\\\\\\"Billable\\\\\\\" amount for the week will appear as $1000. ​\\\\n\\\\n## Utilization\\\\n \\\\n Calculation: # of hours submitted / capacity This is the percent of available/billable work hours that have time submitted. A person's capacity is determined in Resourcing. By default, Resourcing sets everyone's availability to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. ​ Example: A user's work week capacity is 40 hours. They submit 30 hours for the week. Their \\\\\\\"Utilization\\\\\\\" will appear as 75%.\\\\n\\\\nIf a user's availability needs a custom hours, this can be accessed by going to Resourcing > User Profile.\\\\n\\\\nIf the user’s workweek hours are not provided, Hive will utilize the Threshold value specified in the Resourcing settings. In the absence of a Threshold value, Hive will default to the Working day value.\\\\n\\\\n## Utilization Targets\\\\n \\\\nThis is the utilization percentage that is set in each user's profile in Resourcing, as shown here:\\\\n\\\\n## Comments**\\\\n \\\\nTo see and export the comments users left on their timesheet submissions, export the Timesheet reporting with the following settings:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nShow time by week\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDetailed level of export\\\\n\\\\n# Reporting Visibility\\\\n \\\\nBy default, timesheets are routed to Project Owners. This means Project Owners, in addition to Managers and Workspace Admins, can view the time data in Reporting.\\\\n\\\\nUsers can edit the project to route to Managers instead. This means only Managers and Workspace Admins can view the time data in reporting. (To set or adjust managers, edit the user's profile in Resourcing.)\\\\n\\\\nPlease note! Admins can also restrict access to Timesheets reporting to select users only - if you can't find the reporting, it means you don't have access to it. \\\\n Related Articles Submitting your Timesheet Timesheets for Timesheet Approvers Timesheets for Admins Budgets in Hive Track how your team spends time  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3968\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"resourcing\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Resourcing 2.0\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Premium add-on for team capacity planning.

Clicking the pin icon will create a shortcut to the app in your land-hand navigation panel. \\\\n\\\\nNote that access to Resourcing can be restricted under settings. This will be discussed further below under the Settings section. \\\\n\\\\n# Navigating Resourcing\\\\n\\\\nWhen navigating to the Resourcing Application, buttons along the top row allow you to:\\\\n \\\\n- create a new resource Allocation / Assignment / Time Off / Placeholder\\\\n \\\\n- toggle between the User, Teams & Projects views\\\\n \\\\n- change the timeframe displayed\\\\n \\\\n- access the Capacity finder\\\\n \\\\n- apply filters\\\\n \\\\n- access the Resourcing settings page under the 'More' menu. \\\\n \\\\n**Create Button**\\\\n \\\\nClicking **Create **will allow you to create a Project-level Allocation, Action-level Assignment, Time-Off entry for a user, or a Placeholder . Clicking any of these options will open the creation window. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou must select the relevant project, resource, date, and time for your entry. Assignment notes and Leave Types are optional but helpful for context. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Day, Week, Month Toggle**\\\\n \\\\nThe toggle to the right of the creation button allows you to switch views between seeing Users by Project or Project by Users which are discussed below. The **'D, W, M' **toggle allows you to increase or decrease the granularity of your view between Day, Week, and Month. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClicking any of these options will change the date range picker to the right and allow you to customize your view. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Filters**\\\\n \\\\n**Filters **are key to using Resourcing and can be found on the right-hand side of the top navigation panel by clicking on the '**Configure**' button.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFrom here, you can switch between density, toggle between hours and percentages, toggle between estimates and allocations, apply preset saved filters, and access many other filters.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUse the 'Add Filter' button to allow additional options for filtering or hide undeeded filters from the view using the X button.\\\\n\\\\nLet's talk more about these:\\\\n \\\\n**Density - **This option allows you to switch between Compact & Extended density of your Resourcing view.\\\\n \\\\n a) Extended - each project & its data are listed underneath each user.\\\\n \\\\n b) Compact - the view does not include project or user-level sections and instead combines all Estimates to one section and all Allocations to another.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Display as Toggle (Hours and %) - **This toggle changes how data is presented in the Resourcing grid. In previous versions of Resourcing, this was workspace-wide but now this is **user-based. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Utilization Toggle (Estimate vs Allocation) - **This toggle dictates how the calculation in the resourcing grid is being performed. \\\\n \\\\n a) When set to 'Estimate', this is looking at estimated time over a user's total capacity. Each project row shows estimated time for that project over a user's capacity. If the user's time is divided across multiple projects, you can now easily see how this breaks down. \\\\n \\\\n b) When set to 'Allocation', this is looking at the user's allocated hours over their available capacity. It also shows a breakdown at the project level for easy comparison. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also use the '**Compare Est vs Alloc'** Toggle to see the relationship between allocated and estimated hours. With this toggle enabled you will see different data types in the grid that may not have been present before.\\\\n \\\\n0% indicates that a project has an allocation but no estimate present. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHours without coloration indicate that there is an estimate but no allocation present. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis allows you to see everywhere where data is present on the grid while also being able to see the relationship between data. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Presets** - Want to save your filters for the team? Click the 'Select Preset' button which will pop up a \\\\\\\"+Create a preset\\\\\\\" option and save your filters for easy access in the future. \\\\n\\\\nPlease remember that: \\\\n \\\\nYou cannot adjust the previous toggles when in compare mode. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThese toggles and Compare checkbox are **user specific** so it will not impact another resource manager looking at the same data.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Capacity Finder**\\\\n \\\\n**Capacity Finder **is a more advanced filter that allows you to quickly sort through your data. Do you have a last-minute request and need to find out who is available? Use Capacity Finder. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**More Menu**\\\\n \\\\nAccess the Resourcing Settings page and the Resourcing Reporting page.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Resourcing Settings page contains the location for defining how data is shown as well as where placeholders, user tags, project tags, and roles can be created. See below for more details on the Resourcing Settings page. \\\\n\\\\nThe Resourcing app chart shows the designated allocated time and the assigned time that a user is expected to be booked on a project or action. More to come on the differences between allocated and assigned time later in this guide. \\\\n\\\\nWhen allocations are made at the project level and assignments are made at the action or project level they will be reflected on the Resourcing chart as horizontal lines detailing the span of the assignment and the total number of time (hours or percentage of total capacity). The color coding helps to distinguish between allocated time and estimated time as well as identify when someone is over capacity:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Purple**: Allocated time\\\\n \\\\nDark Purple: Hard Allocations\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLight Purple: Soft Allocations\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Blue**: Assigned Estimated Time\\\\n \\\\nDark Blue: Confirmed Assignments\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLight Blue: Unconfirmed Assignments\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Pink**: User is overstaffed; assigned time is over their threshold (i.e., over 8 hours per day) \\\\n\\\\n# Views in Resourcing\\\\n \\\\nThere are three data views available within Resourcing that can be toggled using the button to the right of **Create. **This toggle allows you to choose whether Users, Teams or Projects are at the top of your hierarchy for sorting. \\\\n\\\\n### **Users View**\\\\n \\\\nWhen 'Users' is selected, Users will be the top level with each project they are working on as the second level of the hierarchy. Actions and Resource Assignments will be organized by project, with Time Off in its own row. \\\\n\\\\nThe purple numbers in this view represent the project’s consumed allocation in a percentage. When that percentage is exceeded for a given time frame, we see the change to dark purple and the percentage exceeding 100%.\\\\n\\\\nSo let’s say, for example, we sold “Product Roadmap” for 40 hours of design work over the course of a week. We can set that allocation for the project, and then begin building out our project plan in action cards or resource assignments. As we estimate action cards and assignments, they are compared against the allocation and are shown as a percentage. As a Resource Manager, I know that I can keep my projects within budget and within a timeline as long as I don’t exceed my set allocations. \\\\n\\\\n### **Projects View **\\\\n \\\\nWhen 'Projects' is selected, Projects will be at the top level with each user within the project making up the second level of the hierarchy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this view, the percentage of consumed allocation totaled for the project is shown in purple. This allows you to answer the question \\\\\\\"Across the whole project, are we staying within our available hours?\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis view will also let you answer \\\\\\\"Am I maintaining the total number of hours available to spend by role or resource?\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n### **Teams View **\\\\n \\\\nWhen 'Teams' is selected, Teams will be at the top level with each user within the team making up the second level of the hierarchy. Expanding each user dropdown will allow you to see the list of projects & actions assigned to them.\\\\n\\\\nThe purple numbers in this view represent the team's consumed allocation/estimates.\\\\n\\\\nNote: If the user is part of multiple teams, their name will be displayed under each team accordingly.\\\\n\\\\n# Getting Started\\\\n \\\\n**Adding An Allocation (Project-Level Only) **\\\\n\\\\nTo add an Allocation, you can click 'Create' or drag-and-drop within the allocation field for the selected project and user. \\\\n\\\\n**Adding a Resource Assignment**\\\\n\\\\nTo populate estimated time in Resourcing, you will need the following items: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimated Time\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssigned User(s)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDate or Date Range. \\\\n\\\\nYou can create individual action-level estimates by turning on **Time Tracking **in Apps and adding estimates to your Action Cards as seen below. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also create more general estimates on a project level. Simply click 'Create', or drag-and-drop within Estimated for the relevant date range. You can also double-click on a date to open the 'Create Assignment' window. \\\\n\\\\n# **Allocation vs Estimate **\\\\n \\\\nWhen discussing Resourcing, it is important to distinguish between what is an allocation and what is an estimate for your user or project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Allocation** refers to the number of hours available for a user for a project. Allocation refers to how much a resource is \\\\\\\"planned\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"allowed\\\\\\\" to work on a project, based on who is available and/or most capable of performing the work. \\\\n \\\\nThe allocation capability is commonly used for planning purposes where a user's total availability is allocated across projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you think **allocation, think about what was sold or committed to. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAllocations can be made to specific users at the project level. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThese are \\\\\\\"Purple\\\\\\\" in Resourcing. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThere are two main types of allocation - hard and soft - which are denoted by a checkbox when creating the allocation. \\\\n \\\\n**Hard Allocation**: The team member has been \\\\\\\"confirmed\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"booked\\\\\\\" to work on the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Soft Allocation: **The team member or unnamed resource is tentatively 'penciled in' to work on the project.\\\\n\\\\n**The \\\\\\\"Estimated\\\\\\\" Row in the Resourcing grid is the collection of action cards and Resource Assignments**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Assignments** refer to the booked and estimated time a user has been assigned to work within a project. \\\\n \\\\nAssignments can be made at both the project and action level. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssignments in Resourcing are powered by the estimated time that a user is assigned to work on a project or a tasks within the project\\\\n\\\\n# \\\\n\\\\n# Resourcing Reporting & Exports\\\\n\\\\nResource Reporting can be found under the 'More' menu in the top right corner by clicking 'Reporting'. \\\\n\\\\nThere are three key reports contained within Reporting:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTotal Hours Performance\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject Breakdown \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nStaffing Breakdown\\\\n\\\\n**Filters**\\\\n\\\\nResourcing Reporting comes with in-app filtering available by clicking 'Filters' in the top right corner. \\\\n\\\\nThis will allow you to flex the data based on the time period, projects, roles, and assignees. Project Status refers to the status set on the overview page of each project. \\\\n\\\\n# Resourcing Terminology\\\\n\\\\n### Utilization\\\\n \\\\nUtilization is the measure of how much of your available resources you are currently using. This can be best seen as a formula: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUtilization = All hours logged (excluding [PTO] projects) / Total capacity (workweek)\\\\n \\\\n### Capacity\\\\n \\\\nCapacity is the maximum level of output that someone is capable of delivering \\\\n\\\\n Example: 8 hours/day of availability = 8 hours of capacity for a given day \\\\n\\\\n### Allocation\\\\n \\\\nAllocations are **project-specific units of measure. **They refer to how much a resource is \\\\\\\"planned\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"allowed\\\\\\\" to work on a project, based on who is available and/or most capable of performing the work. There are two main types of allocation - hard and soft - which are denoted by a checkbox when creating the allocation. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Hard Allocation**: The team member has been \\\\\\\"confirmed\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"booked\\\\\\\" to work on the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Soft Allocation: **The team member or unnamed resource is tentatively 'penciled in' to work on the project. An unnamed resource or **placeholder **is always soft-allocated. \\\\n\\\\n### Assignment\\\\n \\\\nThe amount of work [time] assigned for a user. \\\\n\\\\n### Estimate\\\\n \\\\nThe estimated amount of work [time] an action will take to complete\\\\n\\\\n### Placeholder\\\\n \\\\nPlaceholders are unnamed resources used to 'pencil in' who will work on a project or activity. Like your users, placeholders are assigned roles (i.e Copywriter) and can be used to assign work without knowing who on your team will take it. \\\\n\\\\n# \\\\n\\\\n# Settings & User Profiles\\\\n\\\\nTo make the most out of Resourcing, it is important to review Resourcing Settings. \\\\n\\\\nFound by clicking ‘More’ in the top right corner, the settings panel allows you to set thresholds, define how data is shown, and create placeholders, which are a key function of Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\nThe following sections will give an in-depth overview of each tab and how the settings can be used. \\\\n\\\\n## Resourcing Settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n### General\\\\n \\\\nThe ‘General’ tab allows you to set defaults for the workspace. By default, working days are 8 hours and the threshold (the division between blue (in-range) and red (over-indexed)) is set to 8 hours per day.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nIf a user’s Work Week days are not specified at the user level, Hive will refer to the values set in the Threshold to determine their availability. If the Threshold is not configured, Hive will default to the Working Days value.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nIf your team works weekends or another configuration of days, you can note it from this screen. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nOn-screen numerical figures can be shown as hours or utilization percentages. 100% utilization is defined by your threshold. This can be adjusted by the toggles as well. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nLastly, permissions determine who can see and interact with the Resourcing applet. If you set permissions to 'Specific Users', other users will not see Resourcing under Apps. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### Placeholders\\\\n \\\\nDo you know a Project Manager needs to take the work but are unsure which one? Use a Placeholder! \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nPlaceholder roles are defined in Resourcing and allow you to assign or resource work when the exact resource is not yet known. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nNote that you will need to assign a corresponding role to your Placeholder like you would with a regular employee. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### Projects\\\\n \\\\nThe Projects tab allows you to add Project Tags to your projects for further filtering in Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nProject Tags are optional and different from Project Custom Fields. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nProject tags are useful to align filters within the Resourcing and Time Applets where you can filter the grid and report views based on the same project tag values.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### People\\\\n \\\\nThe people tab allows you to assign your team Roles and User Tags (discussed below). \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nBoth of these items can also be assigned to a User’s profile by an Admin. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### Roles\\\\n \\\\nRoles generally follow job titles in an organization. Each user will only hold **one role **in Hive. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nYou will need to create correspond\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 18063\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Staff Your Projects\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4745326-staff-your-projects\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Staff your projects | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Staff your projects \\\\n# Staff your projects\\\\n \\\\nMake decisions based on your team's capacity with Hive Resourcing\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 5 months ago  \\\\nDo any of these overall business goals sound familiar?\\\\n\\\\nYou want to gain visibility into the clients & tasks that are taking most of your team's time\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnsure you are aligning your estimated time with how the team is actually spending time\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFind the most labor-intensive work in your team, and try to optimize this\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDocument for clients the time you spend above and beyond working on their projects\\\\n \\\\nYou're in the right place. We're going to walk through how to configure Hive's Resourcing module, so you can start uncovering these insights and drive some change in your organization!\\\\n\\\\n Note:** It's preferable that you're starting with your projects already created & entered in Hive, so check out one of our other Workflow guides if you haven't completed that step yet! \\\\n\\\\n# ** Step 1: Turn on Resourcing in Hive Apps**\\\\n\\\\nHead to Apps on the left-hand panel and toggle on Resourcing:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Pick your Resourcing \\\\\\\"Zoom Level\\\\\\\" **🔎 :** where do you currently estimate effort for your team's work?**\\\\n \\\\n## Pick which is closest to what your team does.\\\\n\\\\n## a) It's at the task-level - we estimate how long each step in our plan will take, which allows us to be granular.\\\\n \\\\nIn this case, we recommend that Timetracking is also toggled on in Hive Apps so that you can enter estimates onto action cards within your plans. \\\\n\\\\nTo reiterate, task-based estimates are added per person, per action card\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates are usually more granular and are always attached to specific actionable to-dos. Remember actions are things that people can \\\\\\\"do\\\\\\\" & check off their list\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe estimates will follow the project plan, so shifts in the project plan automatically update your Resourcing view\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates appear as guidance for individuals about their allocated time, when they look at My Actions view.\\\\n \\\\nGo to each action card where you want to enter time, and use the Estimates section to add the time. Remember to add the due date to the card, so it will be visible within Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\n**b) If at the Project-level, you will be using resource assignments: estimates are added per person, at the project level.**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis is typically used as broader \\\\\\\"buckets\\\\\\\" of time for blocking out people's availability in assignments when the exact tasks are not known or the level of granularity is too much to maintain for the team\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nResource assignments do not appear in My Actions View - they are not things to be 'completed'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThey do not move with project plan updates\\\\n\\\\nGo to the Resourcing View, and double-click onto the individual's line where you want to add the estimate. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdjust the effort\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the dates\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRemember to confirm! (This sends the user a notification)\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Do you resource by team? **\\\\n \\\\n## Do your team members have assigned teams that you may want to quickly filter to - i.e., show me the Design Team's workload?\\\\n\\\\n**Yes? ** Create teams & set all employees' teams in the Workspace Setting: click on your profile icon, click Settings, navigate to Teams, click the blue \\\\\\\"Create new team\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Does your team have specific roles or special skills?**\\\\n \\\\na) Yes! Great, you can go to the Resourcing Setting, go to People, search for a user, click on their name, and then you'll be able to update the user role or User Tag.\\\\n\\\\nIf you require a user’s role to be modified for a particular project, the Admin or Project Owner can make the necessary adjustments on the Overview page.\\\\n\\\\nb) No, teams is specific enough for my resourcing view. --> No action needed!\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Do you need to allocate time before you know who can take on the work?**\\\\n \\\\nIf so, Placeholders are going to assist in making this possible. A placeholder, like \\\\\\\"Copywriter\\\\\\\" for instance, allows you to assign a task without knowing yet who on your team will take the work. You can see allocations to Placeholders in Resourcing so you know how much work is coming up for a particular team. \\\\n\\\\nTo create Placeholders, head to the More > Settings menu in Resourcing and add from there. \\\\n\\\\nThen, on your projects, select the Placeholders you want to include in that project in the Edit Project Screen:\\\\n\\\\nThen finally, assign the action card to the Placeholder Assignee:\\\\n \\\\n *Note: You can also assign an action card to a Placeholder and a User to an action card! \\\\n\\\\nIf the Estimated time you added exceeds the available hours of the team member who is assigned to this action, you'll be notified that \\\\\\\"This change exceeds <User> availability on <Date>\\\\\\\". User availability is determined based on the user’s Work week hours. This section can be accessed by going to Resourcing > User Profile.\\\\n\\\\nIf the user’s workweek hours are not provided, Hive will utilize the Threshold value specified in the Resourcing settings. In the absence of a Threshold value, Hive will default to the Working day value.\\\\n\\\\n# **Finally, you're ready for the big step **💪 :** Notifying your team of the new resourcing process**\\\\n \\\\nWe think it's best to call a Team Meeting with anyone involved or impacted by the Resourcing workflow (you can always use our guide for Running Great Meetings ). \\\\n\\\\nMake sure you agree on the motions of resourcing your team:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWill you add Estimates & using Placeholders in your Project Templates so you don't need to reinvent the wheel when a new project kicks-off\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow will you deal with overallocation (will people work more hours, or will timelines shift, or will more headcount be required)?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCan everyone see Resourcing, or do you need to restrict visibility for any reason? Review that setting here . \\\\n\\\\n Staffing your team appropriately is both art & science, and we're here to provide the platform to host these great masterpieces! \\\\n Related Articles Time Tracking Quick-Start Guide Using placeholders Adding placeholder resources to projects Resourcing 2.0 - Comprehensive Overview  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 6102\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"hivemind\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"HiveMind / Buzz AI\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"AI assistant integrated across Action Cards, Notes, Mail, and project creation.

But, many teams have custom data that they need to track. This could include:\\\\n \\\\nProject category or type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRegion or office supporting this project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLink to Figma file in a design action card\\\\n \\\\nIf you have specific data you want to track, Hive allows you to create custom fields at both the action and project level.\\\\n\\\\n# Creating action** custom fields\\\\n \\\\nYou will see action custom fields inside each action card within the project that contains that custom field. These custom fields are also visible in Table view.\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'More'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Custom fields'\\\\n \\\\n4. It will open a modal. Click the 'Create new custom field' button   5.

These custom fields are also visible in the Project Navigator, and you can view them in Portfolio View.\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Overview' (this can also be done from the 'More' button)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect '+ Add new custom field' under 'Project custom fields'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect your field type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType in the field name and select options, if applicable\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick 'Save and add'\\\\n \\\\nYou can update the custom field input from the project Overview page or from Project Navigator.\\\\n\\\\nOn the project Overview page:\\\\n\\\\nOn Project Navigator:\\\\n\\\\nClick on the 3 dots to show project custom fields on Project navigator, and select which ones you want to view. It is also possible to sort your projects alphabetically by the custom fields you select as well as filter them by custom field value. This only impacts your view of Hive:\\\\n\\\\n# Editing Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFrom the Project view, go to 'More' -> 'Custom fields' in the project you want to change\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis opens a modal with a list of your custom fields \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo edit, select the pencil icon.

Non-admins are able to create custom fields, but will only be able to edit or delete the ones they have created.\\\\n\\\\n# Deleting Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFrom the Project view, go to 'More' -> 'Custom fields' in the project you want to change\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis opens a modal with a list of your custom fields \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo delete, select the 3-dot icon, select Delete\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChoose \\\\\\\"Delete custom field but keep existing instances\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Delete custom field from all actions\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\nNote:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n \\\\\\\"Delete custom field but keep existing instances\\\\\\\" - This option deletes the custom field from your workspace but if the custom field had any value in it, then that custom field will still be visible.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n \\\\\\\"Delete custom field from all actions\\\\\\\" - This option deleted the custom field from your workspace completely and even the custom fields that had values will be deleted.\\\\n\\\\n# Accessing Custom Field Library\\\\n \\\\nOnce a custom field has been created, it is accessible by the entire workspace. Both project and action custom fields can be turned on or off in individual projects, depending on the additional information you wish to capture within that project.\\\\n\\\\nTo access this library within a project go to More > Custom Fields. You will then be able to toggle On/Off individual fields for the project.\\\\n \\\\nHowever, you can also add custom fields to or remove them from multiple projects/templates as well if you need to do that in bulk. Just click on the number of projects under the Used in column.\\\\n\\\\n# Group your Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\nGrouping the custom fields together is especially helpful when working with large sets of related fields — such as financial or integration-specific fields — reducing the risk of missing key data.\\\\n\\\\n**To create a custom field group:**\\\\n\\\\n1. Navigate to your profile icon at the top right \\\\n \\\\n2. Find Settings in the dropdown\\\\n \\\\n3. Open the Custom Fields section\\\\n \\\\n4. Select the Action card fields or Project fields section\\\\n \\\\n5. Use the Create group option.\\\\n\\\\n**To add a custom field to the group, you can use one of the following ways:**\\\\n \\\\n 1. Edit the existing custom field & move it under the desired group.\\\\n\\\\n2. Create a new custom field & move it under the desired group.\\\\n\\\\n3. Edit the group & bulk-add multiple custom fields to the group:\\\\n \\\\nYou can also easily rearrange groups and fields within each group using simple drag-and-drop!\\\\n\\\\n# Using Custom Fields Groupings\\\\n \\\\nOnce the custom field group is created, you will enable it for your specific project/-s. You can do this using one of the following ways:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDirectly from the Workspace Settings > Custom Fields section\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nToggle on the individual fields on the project level\\\\n\\\\nAfterward, you'll see your custom field grouping appear directly in the action card/project Overview page. The section can be easily expanded/hidden for quick access!\\\\n\\\\nPlease note: Groupings cannot be edited or reordered within action cards.\\\\n Related Articles Hive Forms External Users Dynamic Fields in Hive Forms Create a Jira issue from Hive Multiple conditions in Salesforce triggers  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 6348\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Formula Custom Fields\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5920917-formula-custom-fields\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Formula Custom Fields | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Custom Fields Formula Custom Fields \\\\n# Formula Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\nDynamically calculate custom fields\\\\n A Written by Alexander Heldring Updated over 3 years ago  \\\\nFormula custom fields allow you to create relationships between custom fields using simple or advanced formulas. \\\\n\\\\nFor example, if you have two existing custom fields ('Cost per person' and 'Number of people') you could create a formula custom field ('Total cost') to multiply their values. \\\\n\\\\nFormula custom fields are available for both project and action custom fields.

Ensure your Project Template has a Project Start/Due Date**\\\\n \\\\nCheck that your template has a project start and/or due date. This acts as a link between your project template and any new projects created from this template to ensure that action durations and dependencies transfer over to the new project properly.\\\\n\\\\n**Pro-tip**: Ensure your **new** project also has a project start and/or due date at creation. If your template has a project start/due date, then when creating a new project from the template the project start/due date will automatically be populated for the new project.\\\\n\\\\n## **2. Assign actions to Placeholders**\\\\n \\\\nAssign the actions in your template to Placeholders . Using Placeholders in your template will allow for efficient updates to the actual resources that will be working on those actions in your project. \\\\n\\\\nBefore you can assign actions to Placeholders, check the Template Project Settings page to make sure Placeholders have been added to the Template. Once added to the Template, then Placeholders can be assigned to actions.\\\\n\\\\n## **3. Add durations and dependencies to your actions**\\\\n \\\\nWhile not required, ensuring that the action cards in the Project Template have relative due dates, durations, and dependencies is a best practice for optimizing Project Templates. \\\\n\\\\nWhile you may not know the exact duration for every action in your project, it is still recommended to add approximate start and end dates for each action. That way when applying the template, each action has a starting point to work from when shaping the project plan for the new project.\\\\n\\\\n## **4. Manage Labels and Apply them to Necessary Action Cards**\\\\n \\\\n Labels are a great way to manage key initiatives or categorize certain actions for designated teams. \\\\n\\\\nProject Templates can be pre-set to not only limit which labels are available in the project, but also to have labels pre-applied on action cards. That way when the template is applied for a new project, the action cards in the project come pre-set with their applicable labels helping to maintain project consistency and completeness.\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Grant access to the Project Template to Hive Teams\\\\n \\\\nIn addition to making sure members of a Hive Team have access to a template, members of the Project Template are listed by default in the Project Membership section when new projects are created using the template.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, inviting Teams rather than individuals to templates helps to ensure template membership is kept up to date as team membership changes. New members added to a Hive Team will automatically be granted access to templates and projects where the Hive Team is a member.\\\\n\\\\n## **6. Review your Project Settings**\\\\n \\\\nWhen a project template is used to create a new project, the template's project setting will apply as the default settings for the new project. Therefore, it is important to check that the project and auto-scheduling settings on the project template are appropriate.\\\\n\\\\nIn the project Permission settings, you can define who can edit, apply, and access\\\\n \\\\nthe project template.\\\\n\\\\nPro-tip: In your Workspace Settings, you can also select the project template you'd like to be automatically applied by default each time a new project is created.\\\\n\\\\nChecking that your Project Templates have the above items will set them up for success!\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Action templates Project templates Adding placeholder resources to projects Run a modern agency on Hive New This Week in Hive: August 2021  😞 😐 😃 Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3943\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"gantt\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Gantt Charts & Timeline Management\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Timeline visualization with dependencies, auto-scheduling (standard and strict), critical path, project baselines, date highlighting for what-if scenarios, bulk selection, column customization, zoom, fullscreen, and export to PDF/PNG/XLS.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 3,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 7536,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Gantt Charts\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/694618-gantt-charts\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Gantt charts | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects Gantt charts \\\\n# Gantt charts\\\\n \\\\nThe easiest way to plan your project\\\\n A Written by Alexander Heldring Updated over 5 months ago  \\\\nGantt charts have been around for a long time - what was missing was the ability to actually use** the Gantt chart to execute your project.\\\\n\\\\nWith Gantt charts, Hive allows you to **plan** and **execute** your project, all in the same tool. Let's take a look.\\\\n\\\\n# Create a Project in Gantt View\\\\n \\\\nGo to the project navigator and select +New Project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGive it a title and add description, due date, and attachments as needed\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect sharing settings (you can read more about that here )\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChoose 'Gantt View' as your project layout and select create\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIt should open your new Gantt project. Click +Add an action, type the name, and press enter. Just click on the Gantt chart to give it a start date and deadline. See it in action in the GIF below.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nIn no time, your project plan is all set up! \\\\n \\\\n# Updating Gantt View\\\\n \\\\nOnce you've created a Gantt view, there are lots of ways to customize it for your needs.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing the timeline\\\\n \\\\nGantt view is defaulted to show you a timeline of several months, but you can change it. You can zoom in to look a few weeks or zoom out to look at a project over a whole year.\\\\n\\\\n## Going fullscreen\\\\n \\\\nIf you want to make your Gantt view bigger, you can expand it to cover your whole screen.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing assignees\\\\n \\\\n## \\\\n \\\\n## Marking complete\\\\n\\\\n## Hiding subactions\\\\n\\\\n## Add dates\\\\n \\\\nThere are different ways to add dates to your actions in Gantt view! You can click on the needed cell on the timeline or use our Gantt Table to select dates from the date picker.\\\\n\\\\nPro-tip: to easily update multiple actions with a new date, you can simply copy the date cell on Gantt Table and paste it into the needed one.\\\\n\\\\n## Add Dependencies \\\\n \\\\nClick circle and drag to the beginning of the next action\\\\n\\\\n## Expand your Actions\\\\n \\\\nCheck out the counter and expand/collapse each layer of your subactions. Use additional options in the dropdown to Expand all or Collapse all.\\\\n\\\\n## Wrapping Column Text\\\\n \\\\nRight-click on the title of the action card then choose the \\\\\\\"Wrap column text\\\\\\\".\\\\n \\\\nThis will make the text wrap around in the column.\\\\n\\\\n## Add colors\\\\n \\\\nTo make your Gantt more customizable and visually appealing, as well as create better organization, you can change the color of action card bars.\\\\n\\\\nTo do that, right-click the desired action and select a color. The color will automatically override any label colors from actions, and apply to all project views and summary views. \\\\n\\\\n## Displaying Percentage Completion\\\\n \\\\nIf you wish to display the percentage completion of your parent action card by its subactions, you can enable the “Display percent complete” option in the Configure settings.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also set this percentage completion manually by changing the \\\\\\\"Display percent complete\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"Manually Update\\\\\\\", and then drag the icon to change the percentage.\\\\n\\\\n## Hide/show elements\\\\n \\\\nNavigate to Filters to customize your view and hide or show elements such as milestones, actions, and sections. The \\\\\\\"Show\\\\\\\" dropdown under the Display section will allow you to better visualize independent goals within Gantt. ​\\\\n\\\\n## Highlight changes\\\\n \\\\nWhen a date is changed, you'll see Hive highlighting action start/due dates that were changed as well.\\\\n\\\\nThis makes it easier for your team — specifically project managers — to run \\\\\\\"What if\\\\\\\" scenarios in Gantt before taking action. ​ The highlight will disappear when you change a new date or leave the project & come back in.\\\\n\\\\n## Select multiple actions in Gantt\\\\n \\\\nIn Gantt, you can hover over the action row to find the checkbox, which will help bulk-select action cards and update multiple automatically.\\\\n\\\\n Another way is holding Shift to select all actions in between!\\\\n\\\\n## Settings\\\\n \\\\nYou can also customize your Gantt view and enable or disable different columns based on your needs. These include Status, Start and End date, Duration, Predecessor, Assignee, Labels, Estimate, Total time Tracked and Custom Fields.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have the Duration column enabled, you can see the total project duration which can be extremely handy. The duration is calculated based on the start date of the first action, the due date of the last action, and the number of working days between those days.\\\\n\\\\n## Export \\\\n \\\\nFrom Gantt view you can export to PDF, PNG, Microsoft Project, CSV, Excel, and Excel Chart as well as adjust export settings.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Creating Dependencies Project Baselines Using Hive's Gantt Chart Layout Undo in Gantt Home View: List View (New)!  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 4661\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Critical Path\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/3341605-critical-path\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Critical Path | Hive Help \\\\n•    Using Hive Projects Critical Path \\\\n# Critical Path\\\\n \\\\nCritical path shows the shortest time to complete a project based on important actions in your project plan\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 2 years ago \\\\n To view the critical path of your project, start in the 'Gantt' project view.

To use it, you have to turn it on in your Apps first.\\\\n\\\\n# Creating your goal\\\\n \\\\nAfter turning on the app, you'll be able to create your first goal. You can add such details as Name of your Goal, Owner, Time range, and Goal measurement.\\\\n\\\\n It's possible to measure your goal based on Actions completed (automatic tracking based on action card completion) or Number (manual tracking and updating your goal).\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to track your goal based on completed or overdue actions, you'll get an option to choose either or individual actions as your progress source. From there, you'll be able to select your projects/actions as well as the parent goal if applicable (this new goal will be added as a sub-goal). If you go for 'Selected Actions', you'll see the checkbox to include subactions too. Lastly, you can display your goal as a Progress Bar (shows the percentage of completion) or Current Value (shows the current number of completed actions). \\\\n\\\\nIf you'd like to track your progress manually instead, you can select Number under Goal measurement and then add your Unit of measurement. Available options include Percentage, Currency, or your custom unit. Then you'll get to enter Initial value, Current value, and Goal value. You can also select your parent goal and choose the display type. \\\\n\\\\n# Viewing details and making edits\\\\n \\\\nAfter creating your goal, click on it to see all the details and add or edit things like description, subgoals, projects, and more. Please keep in mind that if your goal is tracked based on completed actions, incomplete actions will always show up at the top. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also change the status of your goal. Hit 'Update status' and voila!\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to see your goal activity, scroll down a little bit and you'll be able to see it just beneath your subgoals. Click 'Show full history' to see it entirely. \\\\n\\\\nWhen you need to reassign goal ownership to someone else, you can do it by clicking on the Owner dropdown. \\\\n\\\\nThe new assignee will get a notification like this: \\\\n\\\\n# Chart view\\\\n \\\\nAnother cool feature available in Goals is the ability to see your goal in Chart view. Click the 3 dots icon in the top right corner > Chart View to give it a try.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional functionality\\\\n \\\\nFrom the same 3 dot menu, you can request status update on your goal (and subgoals) as well as delete it.

Epics, generally, are fewer in number and take longer to complete. Completing epics is usually worked towards per quarter, where a team may aim to complete two or three. \\\\n\\\\nLet's take the below example of an agile working structure including epics and look at how this can be represented in Hive.\\\\n\\\\n**Recommendations:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Nest your Epic projects under the Initiative projects to ensure your project navigator is well organized. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThemes can be presented with Sections or Labels in the projects. This will support filtering and sorting in reports in Summary View. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLeverage Action Custom Fields , which include an available date field option, to capture release information. These can also be sorted and filtered for reporting in Summary View. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCustomize the project Statuses to reflect the different stages of your workflow, including a Backlog status for example. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd a story point to each action, this will carry over into agile reports and help with velocity calculations. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUse sprints to pull actions together across multiple projects and quickly see progress.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreate Hive Teams for each agile team to enable team reporting and grouping.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreate different report layouts (see below). \\\\n\\\\n**Epics View Example (Portfolio View):**\\\\n \\\\nCreate an overview of your Epics to manage Initiatives and underlying projects.\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Dashboard App Example (Dashboard App):**\\\\n \\\\nLeverage the Hive Dashboard app for a custom dashboard of project visuals and reports.\\\\n\\\\n**Initiative View Example (Parent Project / Summary View):**\\\\n \\\\nView your Initiative in a visual roadmap using Gantt View.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Understanding Hive's Platform Hive 2.0 Template Library Run a modern agency on Hive Agile Sprints Hive Best Practices  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 2541\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"reporting\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Reporting, Dashboards & Analytics\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Dashboard widgets (Chart Builder, Timeline, Goals, Notes, Embed, Image, Actions List, Projects List, Text, Button, Section Header, Risk & Issues, Pivot Table).

Common use cases are: ​ To create a summary view:\\\\n \\\\nGo to the Project Navigator \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick Summary Views \\\\n\\\\n3. Click the button for '+ Create summary view' 4. In the new window that opens up, you can select the settings and what information you'd like to check out in your summary view.

Read on for how to customize this for you. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, Portfolio View is a Hive App - read about how to toggle them on & pin them here .\\\\n\\\\nTo access it, click on the Portfolio View text in the left-hand panel. Once you click on that, you will end up in a space like this: \\\\n\\\\n## Components of Portfolio View: Projects, Details & Actions\\\\n \\\\nYou can build a Portfolio view your way, including these 3 building blocks:\\\\n \\\\nThe \\\\\\\"Projects\\\\\\\" dropdown will allow you to select which projects you'd like to see. You can click 'Select all' to have all of your projects added if that's what you need. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe dropdown for \\\\\\\"Project Fields\\\\\\\" allows you to pull in project fields and custom fields.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe dropdown that says \\\\\\\"Actions\\\\\\\" allows you to pull in the status of the actions and subactions that are living across projects listed on the left. The due date for those actions appears, and a checkmark if they are completed. Within the \\\\\\\"Actions\\\\\\\" dropdown, you can decide if you want to see specific milestones, too!\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, we have four project fields pulling in: Status, Description, Project due date, and Project Owner. Status and Description fields can be edited directly from this view - simply double click on the cell next to the needed project! ​\\\\n \\\\n Other fields can be edited within the \\\\\\\"Overview\\\\\\\" button of a project. Just click on the project in the table and click \\\\\\\"Overview\\\\\\\" toward the top right.\\\\n\\\\nActions pulled into the portfolio view will show a due date if they're incomplete, a green check if they're complete, or \\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\" if the action card doesn't exist yet in one of the selected projects. \\\\n\\\\nMilestone actions pulled into Portfolio View will show the date they are due along with the flag icon to indicate that it has been set as a milestone in the project. If an action is set as a milestone in one project, but the same action lives in another and it's not set as a milestone, the difference will be the flag icon beside the date to show where it's a milestone. \\\\n\\\\n## Create, Save & Share:\\\\n \\\\nIf you manage more than one portfolio, and would like quicker access to it, now you can save the view.\\\\n\\\\nTo do so, click the Title of the Portfolio View and create a new one. Now both are available in your drop down!\\\\n\\\\nTo share a view with others, head to the Menu > Share icon on the right:\\\\n\\\\nAnd add your teammates:\\\\n\\\\n### Share a read-only public link to your Portfolio view\\\\n \\\\nWhen Access type is set to 'Anyone with a link', you can copy the share link to your Portfolio view and send it to your stakeholders.\\\\n\\\\nTo share a public link to a filtered Portfolio view, Workspace Admins and Portfolio owner ** can use the 'Lock editing' button at the top of the screen. \\\\n\\\\nWhen enabled, only Workspace Admins and Portfolio owner can filter in the Portfolio View.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The Global icon on your Portfolio view means that the view is shared publicly and any filter changes you make will be reflected in the public view as well.\\\\n\\\\nPortfolio View is best leveraged when looking at multiple projects that have the same action cards and/or custom fields because you can then compare those projects accurately and efficiently. \\\\n\\\\n## How to remove a project from Portfolio View\\\\n \\\\nTo remove a project from a portfolio view, you can select the project and toggle off the button next to the project title.\\\\n\\\\n There's more to discover with Portfolio View, so check out this related post: https://hive.com/blog/portfolio-view/ \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Gantt charts Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive List View: A New Project View in Hive Home View: List View (New)!  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3992\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"user_management\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"User & Team Management\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Invite users, manage Teams, external users (single project access), client mode, workspace sharing, permissions, and role management.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 3,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 10890,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Adding People to Workspace\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/1519549-adding-people-into-your-workspace\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Adding people into your workspace\\\\n \\\\nHive works best with a team!

It breaks down a project into manageable chunks and allows project managers to define and organize the scope of their project in an organized manner. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) also provides an effective way to track project progress and identify dependencies. ​\\\\n \\\\nYou can use WBS while importing a CSV to define action hierarchies and/or predecessors. The structure is as follows: \\\\n\\\\naction.subaction...\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if a row had a WBS value of '3.1' that would mean it is the first subaction of the third action in the list. \\\\n\\\\nIf you import a project with the following WBS: \\\\n\\\\nThen in Hive, it will look like this: \\\\n\\\\nNotice that the action with WBS '3.1.1' is the third level in the action hierarchy. Like actions, there is no limit to the amount of nesting that can be created in a work breakdown structure. \\\\n\\\\nWBS also allows us to create dependencies in CSV imports. If you have a 'Predecessor' column in your CSV, you can reference an actions WBS to create a dependency. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example, once the CSV is imported into Hive Action 2 would be dependent on Action 1 and so on. \\\\n\\\\nNote that 'WBS' and 'Predecessor' are optional columns in the CSV import. If WBS is not present, then all rows will be imported as top level actions. If WBS is present but Predecessors is not, actions will be created in the hierarchy dictated by their WBS but no dependencies will be present. \\\\n\\\\nQuestions about WBS or importing a CSV?

To start, we want to better understand how your team has learned about this initiative.\\\\n\\\\nWas it...\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTriggered by an event in the company\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAn ongoing project that your team is running for the company \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA repeatable tasks that exists or pops-up every week\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA response to requests from other teams or departments \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGiven to the team by leadership\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Sketch It Out in Hive**\\\\n \\\\nOnce we understand what triggered the event, we can take the appropriate actions in Hive. \\\\n\\\\n**If the task was triggered by an event in the company:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreate a new project in Hive for the initiative or task and invite all relevant team members from your organization.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo add a new project, click the \\\\\\\"New\\\\\\\" button in the upper right-hand corner of your Hive window and select New Project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou'll need to add teammates to your project. To do this, click the \\\\\\\"Edit Project\\\\\\\" button in Hive and press the \\\\\\\"Add project members\\\\\\\". They'll now be able to access and visualize this initiative.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf there are relevant documents or additional information, you can attach them in the Project Overview. Access Project Overview by clicking the Overview button when you're inside the project.\\\\n \\\\nAnother component of Hive that you might want to utilize if a task is triggered by an event in the company is Sections.\\\\n\\\\nEvery project goes through a process from start to finish. In some industries, this process is marked by stages. For example, a consulting project might have three section: planning, execution, and closing.\\\\n \\\\n**To use sections in Hive:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen adding sections to a new project **, go to the project navigator, select \\\\\\\"+ New Project\\\\\\\", create the project, click More menu at the top right corner, then scroll down to find the Section, then click \\\\\\\"Add section\\\\\\\".\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you create a new action, it ** adds it to the New section by default **. You change an action's section by clicking the dropdown menu at the top of the action card.\\\\n \\\\nOnce you've set up Sections, you can use them in a few ways:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFilter all actions in Kanban by status\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nView actions broken down by sections in Gantt view\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn Gantt view, you can also group actions by section\\\\n \\\\n**If the task is an ongoing project that your team is running for the company:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis setup is going to look largely the same as the previous, except you will be adding tasks to a preexisting project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you need to add team members to the project, click the \\\\\\\"Edit Project\\\\\\\" button in Hive and add \\\\\\\"Members\\\\\\\" to your project. They'll now be able to access and visualize this initiative.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo add team members to the specific task, you can either tag them in the comments of the action card, or add them as followers by clicking the blue plus sign on the bottom right hand corner.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf the task is part of a collection of tasks that can all be created using the same framework, it could be beneficial to use Hive Templates.\\\\n \\\\nWith templates, you can easily create built-out action cards that have pre-existing content, making it easier for your teammates to understand next steps and action items.\\\\n\\\\nTo access Hive Templates:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to your main menu (upper right corner under your profile picture)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Workspace Settings\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Templates\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"+ Create New Action Template\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nName the template and provide a label if desired\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the subactions, assignees, days, and durations. It will look something like the below. \\\\n \\\\nTo apply a Hive Template, simply open up the action card (or create a new one) and select \\\\\\\"Apply Action Template\\\\\\\" from the dropdown.\\\\n\\\\n**If it is a repeatable task that occurs weekly:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWithin your new project, add a task and set the individual action as recurring\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo make an action recurring, simply click on the \\\\\\\"Due Date\\\\\\\" section of the action card, and click \\\\\\\"Set Recurring\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n**If the task was in response to requests from other teams or departments:**\\\\n\\\\nThere are a few ways to digest tasks passed from a team or department. If the task is coming from another teammate, and you've received it over email, you can easily use Hive Mail to either:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Create a new task from the email.** To do this, simply click into the email from your Hive Mail inbox, then click the checkmark icon above the message. You’ll then be able to access it from My Actions.\\\\n \\\\n**Bonus:** Email threads linked to action cards are dynamic, so they will update with any additional replies that are sent or received. Anyone who has access to the action card will be able to view and reply to the linked messages, ensuring that everyone stays up to date with the latest.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Pull information in on the task from a Hive Form.** This is an easy way to intake project or task data in a repeatable fashion. \\\\n \\\\nHere's how to enable and utilize Hive Forms:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnable \\\\\\\"Forms\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\"Hive Apps\\\\\\\" if it's not already enabled. Pin Forms to your left-hand navigation panel.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nForms will now be easily accessible. To create a new Form, simply click \\\\\\\"Create A New Form\\\\\\\" on the upper right hand corner.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUtilize the Form builder to compile the information for your Form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSet where you want to receive the Form submissions. You can either receive each submission via email, or in a Hive action ( it will automatically create an action in Hive in the project and assigned to the person you select) \\\\n \\\\n Each form come with a link that you can share or post on a website. To access the link, scroll to the top of the form and you will see a white box with a link. Click the button \\\\\\\"copy\\\\\\\" to save it to your clipboard. \\\\n\\\\n**If the task was given to you by leadership:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf a task is passed down to you by leadership as part of a larger initiative, it's easy to add yourself to the existing project that they're working from.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOnce you're in the project, you can work with them to learn more about project set-up, milestones, KPIs, and other components of the project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIt would be helpful to view a macro-level initiative in Gantt view to better understand the tasks, dependencies, and any other moving parts that are involved.\\\\n \\\\nTo view a project in Gantt view, simply enter your project and click the \\\\\\\"Change Layout\\\\\\\" button on the top right. From the dropdown, select Gantt.For a clearer structure, you can group your actions by phases in the Gantt view; navigate to your view settings and select \\\\\\\"Group by Phase.\\\\\\\" Adjust these settings to visually organize your project into logical segments for better tracking.\\\\n\\\\nWithin Gantt view, you'll even be able to customize the tasks and projects to your liking. Here are a few things you can do:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Change the timeline** - Gantt view is defaulted to show you a timeline of several months, but you can change it. You can zoom in to look a a few weeks or zoom out to look at a project over a whole year or several years.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Go full screen** - If you want to make your Gantt view bigger, you can expand it to cover your whole screen.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Change assignees** - Easily assign yourself or your teammates tasks within the larger Gantt view by selecting the task and editing assignee.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Add dependencies** - Dependencies are tasks that depend on the completion of another to be started/completed themselves. To add a dependency, locate the circle on the right hand side of each task and drag to the beginning of the next action.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Add milestones **- Milestones are an easy way to track major accomplishments in your project. They are generally used as a indicator to call out a significant event on your Gantt Chart such as a project launch, key deliverable, or presentation date. To add a milestone, click the flag icon to mark each task as a milestone within an action card. The milestone will then show up as a diamond on the Gantt chart.6. **Group by Phase** - Easily organize and view your project timeline by grouping tasks into phases. To group by phase, adjust your view settings and select \\\\\\\"Group by Phase.\\\\\\\" This functionality provides a clear overview of each project segment and allows for better timeline management.\\\\n \\\\n# **Step 3: Check Out The Big Picture**\\\\n \\\\nNow that we understand how projects can be set up in Hive, it's time to think about the big picture. How can we better understand what's going on in our projects as they progress? There are a few ways to do that in Hive.\\\\n\\\\n## Portfolio View\\\\n \\\\nFirst, there's Portfolio View. This view is the all-in-one place to see the detail of Project Navigator combined with the flexibility of a Table View. \\\\n\\\\nTo access Portfolio View, you'll need to turn it on in Hive Apps, which you can access under \\\\\\\"Apps\\\\\\\" on your left-hand side navigator. The beauty of Portfolio View is that it lets you view actions from across projects, actions, and subactions in once place. This is ideal for teammates who want to better understand how the big-picture is progressing and how initiatives are working together.\\\\n\\\\nTo create a Portfolio View:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFirst select the projects you want to include in the view from the \\\\\\\"Add projects\\\\\\\" dropdown.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect items from the dropdown for \\\\\\\"Project details and fields\\\\\\\" so you can better understand which items you'd like included in the Portfolio View.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUtilize the dropdown that says \\\\\\\"Add actions and subactions\\\\\\\" to pull in the status of the actions and subactions that are living across projects listed on the left. The due date for those actions appears, and a checkmark if they are completed. Within the \\\\\\\"Actions and subactions\\\\\\\" dropdown, you can decide if you want to see specific milestones, too!\\\\n \\\\nIf you manage more than one portfolio, and would like quicker access to it, you can save the view, as well as add another Portfolio View. To do so, click the Title of the Portfolio View and create a new one. Now both are available in your drop down! \\\\n\\\\nTo share a view with others, head to the share icon on the right and add your teammates to the Portfolio View.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, Portfolio View is best leveraged when looking at multiple projects that have the same action cards and/or custom fields because you can then compare those projects accurately and efficiently.\\\\n \\\\n## **Dashboards\\\\n \\\\nDashboards are another way you can understand the big-picture and track tasks across the organization or team. To enable Dashboards, visits Hive Apps and toggle the Dashboards tile on.\\\\n\\\\nFrom there, you'll be able access your Workspace Overview **dashboard which will help you** **better understand progress across teams and your organization.\\\\n\\\\n## Risks and Issues Tracker\\\\n \\\\nAnother great tool that you can use in Hive to manage initiatives as they unfold is the risk and issues tracker functionality. \\\\n\\\\nTo turn on this aspect of Hive, simply visit Hive Apps and toggle on \\\\\\\"Risks and Issues Tracker.\\\\\\\" Your team can now use the tracker to manage the risks and issues in each of your projects in one centralized location.\\\\n\\\\nTo add a new issue, open the tracker and enter the name of the risk you would like to keep track of. Be sure to select the project the risk is associated with.\\\\n\\\\nIf project phases remain invisible, you can create a more streamlined view by enabling proper grouping settings. Under Gantt view, access the \\\\\\\"Configure settings\\\\\\\" and ensure that \\\\\\\"Phases\\\\\\\" is selected as the grouping option. Save the configuration to have clear visibility into each project phase.\\\\n \\\\nThe card is now linked with the project. To see it directly in the project, you can create a new Risks tab:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Time To Expand**\\\\n \\\\nNow that you've got your project running smoothly in Hive, it could be time to bring new project members into the fold. Maybe you need to show an external agency your progress, or maybe you're onboarding new team members.\\\\n\\\\n**External Users**\\\\n\\\\nWhen you've got external collaborators who need access to Hive, you can easily accomplish this through external users. External users are limited to the actions and messages within the assigned project and do not have access to your entire workspace.\\\\n \\\\n**​\\\\n \\\\n To add an external user:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick the \\\\\\\"Invite\\\\\\\" button on your project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Invite New Members window will open. Select the tab that says \\\\\\\"Guest user.\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the email address of the person you want to invite and select the project(s) you want to add them to. After you click send invite, they will now have access to the project(s) you selected.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo add an external user to another project, go to the project’s homepage (you can get there by going into the project and clicking the “Home” button). Scroll to the very bottom to the External users section. Any existing external users for the project will be listed here. Click “+ Add external user.\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n**Onboarding Additional Teams**\\\\n\\\\nIt's easy to add additional team members to your Hive workspace. To do so, simply press the \\\\\\\"Invite\\\\\\\" button on your home screen and enter your teammates email. From there, you'll be able to add them to the project that are relevant to their work. Hive will then notify the user!\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Optimize your Meetings**\\\\n \\\\nIf your team meets or regroups on the initiatives, leverage Hive Notes to plan the meeting, collaborate during the meeting, and convert 'next steps' in action items in your project.\\\\n\\\\nShare the Hive Note with other Hive users to collaborate in real-time on the meeting Note or share it externally as an email with non-Hive users or leadership to keep them informed. \\\\n\\\\nIf you have new action items from the team meetings, you can write them out, highlight them, and then click the checkmark icon and this will create new action cards directly in your project so the team won’t lose track. The best part is that the status, owner\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 15375\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Manage Complex Timelines\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755427-manage-complex-project-timelines\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Manage complex project timelines | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Manage complex project timelines \\\\n# Manage complex project timelines\\\\n \\\\nAn powerful tool for the PMO & the PMO within all of us\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 2 months ago  \\\\nHive has everything you need to manage large-scale, multi-workstream project plans and with this get-started guide, we'll have your timeline loaded into Hive in no time.\\\\n\\\\nLet's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Where is your project plan now? **\\\\n \\\\n**a) It's in another tool & I'm planning to import it**\\\\n \\\\nGreat, hop over to our Import Guide to review the steps, and come back here once you've imported it\\\\n\\\\n**b) I'm starting from scratch**\\\\n \\\\nOk, let's get you started by creating a New Project (New > Project) with:\\\\n \\\\nTitle\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDue date\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGantt layout\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSections: hold off for now, we will get to that next\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nShared with: we recommend starting with just yourself for now, but our Draft Mode works well if you'd like to add your teammates but not notify them of assignments until you're finished with the plan. \\\\n \\\\n**Tip:** once your project is created, click the configure menu to change the available columns and filters\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Map out the workstreams **\\\\n \\\\n## How does your project naturally 'break down':\\\\n \\\\n**a) By major Stage or Sections of work, with individual steps within these sections owned by specific teams or departments**\\\\n \\\\nIf this is the case, we recommend that you set up Sections within your project to be those major lifecycle stages that everything in your project can be categorized into.\\\\n\\\\nSections are added by going to More > Edit Project > and adding the sections there.\\\\n\\\\nYou can then enter actions into the sections, when you group by section or drag existing actions into your sections:\\\\n\\\\n**b) By Workstream or Department: each team runs their own segment of this overall project and we don't organize into the same lifecycle stage across all work streams. **\\\\n\\\\nIn this case, we recommend that if your Department work streams are more than 30 specific tasks, that these be all labeled the same, and then you view your timeline grouped by Label rather than by Section. Create the labels directly on the action cards using the '+' icon. Here's everything about labels to learn more. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Configure your gantt to work for you **😀\\\\n \\\\n## If any of these would make your life easier - proceed as directed!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like the gantt timeline to auto-adjust my dates: if one date shifts, subsequent dates should be auto-scheduled by Hive** 👉 Turn on Auto-scheduling , or even Strict Auto-scheduling (see link for more).\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like Hive to show my action card as completed if all the subactions are completed, automatically **👉 Toggle on this setting in the Edit Project screen:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like Hive to calculate the start and end date of my parent actions, based on the earliest & latest dates of the subactions** 👉 Toggle on this setting in the Edit Project screen:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like to be able to view all milestones across all projects at once** 👉 Flip those action cards into Milestones and then create your Milestone Report . \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Add your actions into the project**\\\\n\\\\nUse the prompts on the gantt chart to enter your actions one-by-one, or did you know you can copy + paste from a list and Hive will generate separate actions?\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Inviting the team & assigning work**\\\\n \\\\nNow, for the do-ers of your project plan. Head to the Invites section to invite everyone who is responsible to complete a part of this project plan . \\\\n\\\\nRemember, your internal team members within your organization would be regular members, while external parties who may need access to a single project or who are outside of your organization, could be External Users . \\\\n\\\\nWith everyone assigned out their work, it's time to begin! 📈\\\\n\\\\nOnce work is assigned, team members can refer to their My Actions page to see their action and task assignments across all of their projects.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Gain Approval for Deliverables**\\\\n \\\\nIf your deliverables need to go through an internal or external review process, leverage the proofing and approval capabilities in Hive to receive feedback and track approvals.\\\\n\\\\nUpload files for review in the Hive Proofing tool where multiple team members can simultaneously conduct a review, adding comments and markups in real-time.\\\\n\\\\nCreate approval routes that go to multiple users, teams, as well as external approvers (those without Hive accounts).\\\\n\\\\nWhen it's your turn to review, you'll receive a notification and the request for your approval will appear on your My Actions page to easily tracker all of your approval requests.\\\\n\\\\n# **For additional power-ups, we recommend:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nKicking off the project with Running a Great Meeting \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nKeeping track of key dates in Portfolio View \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNoting any major concerns through our Risks & Issues Tracker \\\\n Related Articles Gantt charts Plan & execute company initiatives New this Week in Hive: June 2021 List View: A New Project View in Hive Home View: List View (New)!  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 5063\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Run a Modern Agency\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5099914-run-a-modern-agency-on-hive\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Run a modern agency on Hive | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Run a modern agency on Hive \\\\n# Run a modern agency on Hive\\\\n \\\\nLeverage Hive to enable your Agency workflow from end to end\\\\n Written by Dee Miller Updated over a year ago  \\\\nHive can support every step in your campaign lifecycle from brief to progress reporting. With our step by step guide you can get your campaigns set up ready to go, tracking included. \\\\n\\\\nLet's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: How do your work requests, campaigns or projects begin? Let’s build a seamless work request and briefing system for you.**\\\\n \\\\nWhen initiating projects or campaigns, work generally begins with a brief or request. Create a ** Hive Form ** to capture the request and move away from inconsistent email and duplicate documents. Hive offers you the option of creating an action card in an intake project, ready for triage or creating a project directly from the submission. \\\\n\\\\nTypes of request great for Hive forms:\\\\n \\\\nNew client brief submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative resource or support requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd hoc client requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd Ops Trafficking\\\\n \\\\nHere is an example of a creative resource request and a new campaign brief:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Action card **\\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form is used to collect resource requests for a creative team. The Hive form is creating an action card with the request details for additional resource and landing this in a specific project ready for the triage and assignment:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Project** \\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form collects the briefing information and creates a campaign from a template, ready for the media team to start work. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your Project Navigator and utilise Project Custom Fields for specific campaign information. **\\\\n \\\\nThe project structure must reflect how you organize and execute work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team. \\\\n\\\\nDetermine the structure that’s right for your team by thinking about how the work is structured:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLine of business\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject-based\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign-based\\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create specific guidelines for your Hive users to explain any require naming conventions for your campaigns or projects when applying a template or creating a project. \\\\n\\\\n**Project Custom Fields**\\\\n\\\\nFor custom campaign data that you’d like to track and see displayed on the Project Navigator, project views and included in the Portfolio view, setting up ** Project Custom Fields ** can be incredibly useful. \\\\n\\\\nCampaign data can include:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Budget\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Tier\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient name\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient line of business or product\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSLA details\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nExec Sponsor\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the 'More' menu in the upper right\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create custom field'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType the name of the field you want to add, select the field kind & type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHit 'Save'.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Create a non-campaign or ad-hoc projects to capture tasks outside of your campaigns; support this with a label for easy reporting. **\\\\n \\\\nFrom time to time, tasks and work will occur that is outside of the campaign template. It can help track these for review, assignment or including in your campaign update or QBR with clients.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend creating an Ad Hoc ** project ** where team members can create action cards corresponding to any non-campaign or ad-hoc work requests at a client or channel level. \\\\n\\\\nDoing this will allow you visibility into additional work requests that may be aligned to your organisation’s channels but not specific to any client. At the same time, a client-specific project will give visibility to client-related ad hoc tasks. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create a Hive label that can be applied to all ad-hoc tasks; this will enable you to leverage a Summary view to report all non-campaign tasks across your portfolio. See the next step on how to create labels. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create your labels to categorize work across your campaigns **\\\\n \\\\nWith ** labels **, you can categorize your actions across projects. By creating labels for channels, organization groups, regions or any vital information you would like to group actions and tasks across campaigns or projects, you can easily create a report with a summary view. \\\\n\\\\nLabel data can support:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA Summary View of all work sent to an off-shore hub\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll actions within a specific channel across all campaigns\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll Ad-hoc or non-campaign work-in-progress or complete for a particular client. \\\\n \\\\nJust like an action, you can also create labels with relationships. This gives you more organization and flexibility in categorizing your actions. For example, you may wish to create labels for your channels and group them by region. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Utilize project templates for quick campaign set-up and action templates for processes to support campaign delivery. **\\\\n \\\\n**Project Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** project templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine your campaign plan with the settings, structure and specific steps you need to take in a particular type of campaign or project. Project templates give you the benefit of templating sections, labels, actions, subactions, assignees, custom fields and durations.\\\\n\\\\nRemember that a template has the same qualities as a project, so take advantage and add extras to the template to best represent your campaigns (labels, milestones, etc.) so you can save time once you kick off a live campaign. By including milestones to define KPIs in your template, you will be able to leverage Hive’s Portfolio view and Summary Views to deliver detailed campaign reports based on critical milestones throughout the campaign lifecycle. \\\\n\\\\nProject templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative campaign set-up\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nE2E campaign timelines\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient onboarding projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel Specific campaigns\\\\n \\\\n**Top Tip: **If you have your campaign plan, SLAs or E2E Lifecycle in CSV, it can be quickly uploaded to Hive and ready to go rapidly. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip #2:** Ensure you have a project-level due date on your template that correlates to one of the template’s action due dates. Choose a new due date when applying the template, and all dates will shift according to that date. If no due date is on the template when applied, dates/durations of actions will not carry over. \\\\n\\\\n**How to create a new template**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to the 'Templates' tab on the Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect '+ New Project Template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild the template like you would a project (name, dates, labels, description, attachments, sections)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect who you'd like to share the template with & its permission settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the default layout for the template\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSee the template in the 'Templates' tab\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild out the template as you would a project (you can add actions and subactions and include start and due dates, assignees, labels, etc.) \\\\n\\\\n**Action Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** action templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine the specific steps you need to take in a particular type of task. Applying an action template to an action auto-populates a set of subactions. You can build action templates with labels, assignees, dependencies and ** deadlines **. \\\\n\\\\nAction templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nReports \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative approvals\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nQA rounds\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign briefing \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFinancial reconciliation\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Create your Teams in Hive**\\\\n \\\\nManaging many users is made easy by creating a team in Hive to represent the teams and working groups across your organization. By adding a team to a project every time the team is updated, project members of all projects where the team is a member will be auto-updated. You can add teams to projects, summary views, templates, group chats, comments and tasks within your workspace. This ensures you have the right Hive project members added to the correct campaigns to get to work faster. \\\\n\\\\nHere’s how to create and manage your ** Hive teams **:\\\\n\\\\nTo create a team, go to the \\\\\\\"Manage users\\\\\\\" tab in your workspace settings. You can find this by going to 'Your Profile Dropdown' > 'Manage Users' > 'Teams'. \\\\n \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Teams\\\\\\\" to search existing teams, Edit or Delete existing teams, or create new teams. \\\\n \\\\n**Note:** Only admins or the creator of the team will be able to Edit/Delete teams. \\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"+Create new team\\\\\\\" button will open the following options where you can enter a team name and select workspace members to be part of the team.\\\\n\\\\nTo edit your team click the edit pen icon, and you will be able to amend the membership and name of your team. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n** Summary Views **are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It's handy for managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your client or channel team. A summary view set to table view focused on your client team in Hive or channel label including all projects will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by the due date to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active campaigns to pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Create a Portfolio view to track live campaigns **\\\\n \\\\n** Portfolio View **is the all-in-one place to see the detail set out in Project Navigator combined with a Table View’s flexibility. You have control to build a Portfolio view your way, including Campaigns, Campaign details & Actions; these three building blocks create your portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\nA portfolio view can support live Campaign reporting. When you want to see a picture of all live campaigns for a specific client, including all milestones and project custom fields containing important campaign details, navigate to Portfolio view via your apps menu and start creating your custom portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **You can leverage this view in your status meetings and update the campaign status, description, and other available project information from within the portfolio view. The actions presented enable you to click straight through to the action card and update/review any specific tasks without leaving a portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive and Salesforce Hive 2.0 Template Library Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

Use this guide to get started with setting up your creative workflow in Hive. Let's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Choose your project structure. What is your team type? **\\\\n \\\\n Choose the style closest to you. \\\\n\\\\n## **a) A Marketing & Communications team at a university, institution or organization. **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the Teams / Work streams that you have. For example, you may create work in the following areas and these would each have a project in Hive:\\\\n \\\\nVideo\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEvents\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNewsletters\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBlogs\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPublic Relations: media relations, interviews, press releases\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite content\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite development: Do you maintain more than one domain/site? Make them child projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSocial Media posts: list channels\\\\n\\\\n## **b) A Marketing or Creative team for your company’s product or service **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the major categories of marketing work you produce, for example you may have work in the following categories:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProduct Marketing\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPartnerships\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSales Enablement\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nContent Calendar\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGeneral Marketing (everything else)\\\\n\\\\n## **c) You create deliverables or perform marketing services when requested by your clients**\\\\n \\\\nGreat! Follow-up question here: are you paid for the marketing/creative services? Or, phrased another way - are your clients internal to your organization or are they outside of your organization?\\\\n\\\\n**> If your deliverables are unpaid or clients are internal**\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend that your projects are the **type** of requests you receive from those inside your organization. For instance, let's say you are producing creative marketing materials for real estate agents within your organization. The projects would be the categories of creative work you have, like: Business Cards, New Agent Website, New Listing Postcard, Open House Flyer, Door Hangers. \\\\n\\\\n**> Your deliverables are paid or your clients are external**\\\\n \\\\nCongratulations, you are the traditional 'client based' model for project set-up! We recommend that you create a parent project for each client, and child project is the scope of work, or project sold underneath that client. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Time for a big decision **🤔 - **actions or projects for your work? **\\\\n \\\\nWe are at a fork in the road here! You need to choose if your work is action cards or projects. The rule of thumb is:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project typically takes longer than 30 days or more than 10 major steps, these would usually be **projects. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project is typically shorter than 30 days, or fewer than 10 major steps, the work is usually **action cards. ** \\\\n \\\\nHere's an example of each:\\\\n\\\\n**Action Cards**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, each of the blog articles are on an action card within the Blog Content project. Each blog article has about 5-6 steps and takes a few weeks to complete:\\\\n\\\\n**Projects**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, the website launch has a few components: design, animations, development, QA & user testing and it spans a few months. This makes sense to be its own project.\\\\n\\\\n**Activity: **Create projects in Hive based on the team type & scale recommendation. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Pick your starting point: **how does work usually come to your team?\\\\n \\\\n Pick the option closest to you, but if there are many, it's ok! You can set up each one. \\\\n\\\\n## a) With a request from another team or outside party\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend setting up Hive Forms to manage the intake process. This will standardize the information that your team receives, and eliminate the back-and-forth over email. Once you have your Form created, be sure to share the URL with anyone who makes these requests from you. Putting the link in your email signature is a great idea to promote the new request flow. \\\\n\\\\nReview our Forms Tutorial here and our Video Tutorial here . \\\\n\\\\n## b) With an email request\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you connect Hive Mail, and use the 'Create action from email' option to quickly turn incoming requests into actionable to-dos for your team, slotting them into the correct project and assigning to a team member. \\\\n\\\\n## c) With a weekly, monthly, quarterly planning meeting\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you create a Hive Notes series for this recurring meeting, so you can add a new entry each time the planning meeting occurs, create action items directly form the meeting and put them into your Hive Projects to begin work.\\\\n\\\\nJust start by creating the Hive Note, title it, add an agenda, and share it with attendees of this meeting. The next time this meeting occurs, open the Hive Note & use this for meeting decisions, and action items. \\\\n\\\\n**Activity:** Toggle on Hive Mail, Create Hive Form and/or Create Meeting Note\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Get your supporting apps ready**\\\\n\\\\n## Does your team have creative review cycles? If yes, turn on Proofing & Approvals in Hive Apps\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor internal reviewers, you will be able to route creative work to them as long as they are members of the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor external reviewers - like clients, vendors, partners and others outside of your organization who do not have a Hive license, you will use External Proofing , and you will send them the file using their email address only. \\\\n\\\\n## **Does your team need assistance in Resourcing capacity, keeping track of time or timesheet reporting? If yes, turn on Resourcing, Timesheets so you are ready**\\\\n \\\\nFollow the Workflow Guides for these use cases here::\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Staffing your projects \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Tracking how your team spends time. \\\\n\\\\nActivity: Turn on Proofing & Approvals, Timesheets & Resourcing\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: No time like the present to get your work into Hive**\\\\n\\\\n## Where are your projects and to-dos right now?\\\\n\\\\n**a) You're starting in Hive with a blank slate, not importing from another tool or copying a list of tasks from anywhere!**\\\\n \\\\nNow that you have your projects created, create the action cards with each of the deliverables that your team currently has to do in these projects. Even better, ask another member of the team to assist. \\\\n\\\\n## b) You're importing from another tool\\\\n \\\\nHive can ingest project data from other tools when it's exported in common formats, like CSV and JSON and we have built importers for tools like Basecamp, Trello, Asana and Smartsheet. Follow the import guide here to gather the project work from other tools and import it into Hive. \\\\n\\\\n## c) You have a list of tasks in Excel or other spreadsheet\\\\n \\\\nIf you have a list of tasks in a spreadsheet, or word doc, just copy & paste to put them into Hive. \\\\n\\\\nActivity: Add the action items into Hive using the selected method\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Rally your troops**\\\\n \\\\nNow is a good time to add your team members to the Hive workspace and assign them to their tasks. \\\\n\\\\nYou can invite them & add them to the relevant projects all at once:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: It's go time **🚀\\\\n \\\\nHere is your final checklist to launch now that you have your Projects, Actions, Intake method & supporting Hive Apps (Mail, Notes, Forms) ready to go. \\\\n\\\\n**Final Checklist:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPick your Hive Launch Day & schedule a team meeting for this day\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHost a Hive Launch Day introduction meeting for your team, sharing your screen and showing them how the new creative workflow will happen in Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCelebrate - you're launched! \\\\n Related Articles How to Create an Account in Hive Run successful client engagements Run a modern agency on Hive Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue Introducing Hive University  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 7587\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Run Great Meetings\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755003-run-great-meetings\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Run great meetings | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Run great meetings \\\\n# Run great meetings\\\\n \\\\nUtilize Hive to meet more efficiently.\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 4 years ago  \\\\nMeetings are at the core of the modern workweek. Use this quick-start guide to get started in Hive and optimize your meeting flow and structure.\\\\n\\\\nDo any of these issues sound familiar?\\\\n \\\\nI don't even know what this meeting is about. Could it just be an email?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I make sure that the meetings we conduct are actually productive with everyone working from home?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I be sure that everyone actually does what they say they'll do before our next sync?\\\\n \\\\nHive has got you covered. In this article, we'll walk through how to optimize your Hive experience to run the best possible meetings and ensure timely and efficient follow-ups. A stellar meeting is a few minutes away.\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Create a Hive Note for your meeting**\\\\n \\\\n**Every great meeting starts with an agenda**. Prepare for the most productive meeting of your life by using Hive Notes to create an agenda and share the note with your teammates. To get started with Hive notes:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on \\\\\\\"Notes\\\\\\\" in the bottom right hand corner of Hive to open the Notes panel.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"New Note\\\\\\\" to create a new note.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssign the Note to a project and any new actions created from the Note will map into that project automatically.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd your agenda items to the note and share with your team by clicking on the \\\\\\\"Share\\\\\\\" button on the note's upper right-hand corner. Additionally, the meeting Note can be sent externally as an email to leadership or clients.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Kick the Meeting Off**\\\\n \\\\nYou've sent around the agenda, and now it's time to kick off the meeting. That's where Hive's Zoom integration comes into play. To ensure that your Zoom account is linked to Hive, complete the following steps:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nVisit \\\\\\\"Hive Apps\\\\\\\" in the left-hand panel navigation section of Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nToggle on the Zoom integration tile, and enter your Zoom details\\\\n \\\\n**Now it's time to start the meeting in Hive, and there are a few ways to do that:**\\\\n\\\\nGo to the messaging group, or direct message, where you want to start a meeting. From there, you can start a meeting in a few ways:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType \\\\\\\"/zoom\\\\\\\" in the group or direct message. A Zoom meeting will automatically be started.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on the Zoom icon on the top right corner of your messaging window.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn the messaging input box, click the + button and select \\\\\\\"Create Zoom Meeting.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Assign Next Steps**\\\\n\\\\nOnce you're in the meeting, you can utilize the Notes collaborative functionality to add notes, next steps, and action items into the Note itself. \\\\n\\\\nTo add an action item into the Note and assign it as a next step, simply select all text that you would like to make a next step and click on the check mark on the bottom left hand corner of the formatting box.\\\\n\\\\nNext, you can assign the next step to someone on your team by clicking on the assignee section and selecting a team member from the dropdown. You can also easily assign a due date.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Link your note to a calendar event **\\\\n \\\\nWant to quickly capture the attendee list and meeting logistics? You can easily do that by syncing your calendar with Hive. \\\\n \\\\n**To enable Hive Calendar, visit the Apps section on the left-hand tool bar and select Hive Apps. Hive Calendar is an available app listed here. Toggle it on, and sign in to your email account and authorize the connection. \\\\n\\\\nOnce enabled, go back to your note and link it to your meeting. Hive will populate all the meeting details for you! \\\\n\\\\n# Step 5: Follow-up with Teammates and turn your ad hoc emails into actions in your project**\\\\n \\\\nNeed to follow-up with teammates or external parties after the meeting? You can do that from inside Hive with Hive Mail.\\\\n\\\\nTo enable Hive Mail , visit the aforementioned Apps section on the left-hand tool bar and select Hive Apps. Hive Mail is an available app listed here. Toggle it on, and sign in to your email account, authorize the connection, and you'll be all set!\\\\n\\\\nThe opportunities with Hive Mail are limitless. In addition to following up on any Notes and next steps assigned, you can also:\\\\n\\\\n**Turn your email into an action card in Hive**\\\\n\\\\nActions you create from an email will be private and assigned to you by default, and the email thread will live in the action card.\\\\n\\\\nTo create an action from an email, click into the email from your Hive Mail inbox, then click the checkmark icon above the message. You’ll then be able to access it from My Actions.\\\\n\\\\n**Link emails to existing actions**\\\\n\\\\nReceive an email that’s relevant to your meeting, or something you’re already working on? You can link emails to existing actions as well! To do so, click into the email from your Hive Mail inbox, then click the link icon above the message. This will embed the email thread into your action card.\\\\n\\\\n**Reply or forward messages right from your action cards**\\\\n\\\\nNo need to hop from action card to inbox. With Hive Mail, you can reply, reply all, or forward messages right from the action card. Circling back has never been easier.\\\\n\\\\n**Send a new email from within an action card**\\\\n\\\\nClick the New Message button to begin a new email chain that will live in the action card.\\\\n\\\\n**Maintain visibility**\\\\n\\\\nEmail threads linked to action cards are dynamic, so they will update with any additional replies that are sent or received. Anyone who has access to the action card will be able to view and reply to the linked messages, ensuring that everyone stays up to date with the latest.\\\\n\\\\nThese tips are just a few of the ways you can utilize Hive to run your most efficient meetings.

Hive can seamlessly support your ticketing, triage and work assignment for trafficking and ad hoc work requests. \\\\n\\\\nBelow, we detail the optimal configuration used by our media agency clients around the globe!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Capture all work requests consistently by creating a Hive form.**\\\\n \\\\nTo ensure you can efficiently capture all work requests across your organization and networked agencies, create a ** Hive form **and land these in a defined project for triage, assignment and labelling relevant to your reporting needs. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** For Hive users within your workspace, pin the form for easy access within the New button menu. For Hive users in other workspaces or external individuals to your organization supply them with a handy URL to take them straight to the form. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example, let’s look at this in practice; in this example, a form has been set up to capture data operations requests. When the request is submitted, Hive lands this in an intake project for review where the action card can be assigned to a team member, the due date populated, and work can begin quickly. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your project navigator to house your work queue. **\\\\n \\\\nIt is vital to ensure that the project structure reflects how your team organizes and executes work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team.\\\\n\\\\nDetermine the suitable structure for you and think about how you manage your work queue, assignments, reporting needs, and stakeholder access to the intake projects. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Nesting projects within Hive enables you to manage focused work request queue while leveraging the parent project to look across all nested projects in one view. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Utilize action card custom fields to tailor the action cards to your needs and turn on action card ID.**\\\\n \\\\nThere will be specific details you will need to capture via the request form, which you will want to include in your task details and your reporting. \\\\n\\\\nSet up your form to populate ** action card custom fields ** to ensure that data is presented to your team members and visible in the table view as a column for easy sorting. \\\\n\\\\nBy turning on the action card ID, you can quickly search for the ID in our search function to find specific task or actions details. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create labels to help categorize your actions**\\\\n \\\\nDo you need to report or segment work requests by department, agency, channel or client? When managing your work requests via an intake project, Hive can help you manage your work queue by leveraging labels. \\\\n\\\\nCreate ** labels ** and nest them into functional groupings to support your teams in quickly applying the correct labels. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **Include your labels on your action templates to help support your tracking. The action template can be applied when a request is submitted to ensure that you have all the correct information to hand as soon as the request arrives in your queue. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Create an action template to populate recurring actions, deadlines, labels and assignments**\\\\n \\\\nTo quickly get your teams to work, template recurring tasks that should be followed for each work request with an ** action template .** \\\\n\\\\nThis enables you to add relevant labels, automatically assign work to team members, ensure ** deadlines ** are presented correctly in line with your SLA and provide a consistent workflow for progress reporting and work capacity management. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Set up custom status in the status view to reflect the stages of your workflow**\\\\n \\\\nA custom ** status ** can reflect specific stages in your workflow; on Hold, With Client, or QA are helpful examples of custom status that can be employed to help report on the status of work and communication with project teams. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Connect Hive mail to quickly follow up on form submissions**\\\\n \\\\n** Hive mail ** enables you to attach email strings to existing work requests to support fast follow-ups, confirmations and proactively seeing additional information to help workflow smoothly. You can create an email, reply or forward emails directly from within your action card.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Consider Card priorities level options to help your teams prioritize work requests.**\\\\n \\\\nWant to make sure your teams address high priority items first? Utilize ** Priority Levels ** in Hive and customize it to meet your specific needs. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 9: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n Summary Views are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It is beneficial for traffickers, managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your queue. A summary view set to status view focused on your team in Hive, including all projects, will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by label and priority to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active tasks and pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive Forms Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

As your team works in Hive, each user will have the option to customize their experience, whether that is custom-building their home screen, picking a preferred view in projects, or even determining how they access Hive and the notifications they receive. \\\\n\\\\n**It is important to start simple**. Your team's first impression of a new tool will be made in a few seconds, and your first goal should be to **excite rather than intimidate** with features and processes. \\\\n\\\\nMany teams are comfortable with the technical aspects of Hive following our Hive 101 University course , but the complexity comes as you add your own internal processes. **Make sure to document your decisions and build out process flows** for your team. \\\\n\\\\nIf your end goal is reporting, you will want to build standardized and repeatable processes.\\\\n\\\\nSome questions you may be asked right away could include: \\\\n \\\\nWhat does our organization consider to be a project?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow does a project start? Who manages it as a whole?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWho assigns tasks? What tasks should I expect?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat is expected of me after a task is assigned? How do I work with coworkers?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf more than one person is assigned, who reports progress?\\\\n\\\\n# Before You Begin\\\\n\\\\nThe most important part to have in place before beginning is an understanding of your teams and their workflows. Having workflows defined upfront can help you start fresh or best transition from other tools. \\\\n\\\\nIf you are transitioning from another tool, remember that Hive is an opportunity for a fresh start. Bringing years-old work into a new platform does not add much benefit, and can lock you into old processes that may not work well. Hive's Best Practice is to leave old work in your old tools and to start as fresh as possible. \\\\n\\\\n Build Hive based on your workflows \\\\n\\\\nMany teams choose to do whiteboarding sessions to define their workflows, while others gather feedback from each of their teams. Complexity, such as labeling systems or required data points, can be added later; however, the initial goal when introducing users to a new platform is to demonstrate **how it can help them on a day-to-day basis. **\\\\n\\\\nSome questions to define in advance could be: \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nHow do my teams differ? Does my marketing team have a different process from my communications team? Is there overlap or cross-functional work?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat data do I use now? What data do I expect from my project management tool?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow does work come in now? (i.e, email requests, form submissions, quarterly planning)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow will I organize my team's work?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWho is responsible for managing workloads? Who assigns the work?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow do we plan to review work? What happens during the work phase, and what are my expected outcomes?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat do I expect my team to do on a daily basis in the tool? Does my leadership team interact differently from my project managers? \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen work is finished, how do I plan to report on it? What happens next?\\\\n\\\\nHive differs from word processors and Excel files in the fact that it allows you to define and adhere to repeatable processes. Many teams coming into Hive don't struggle with the tool itself but rather with defining a process that has never been defined before. \\\\n\\\\nCan you draw out how your organization or team manages work from start to finish?\\\\n\\\\n# Core Concepts\\\\n\\\\nAt its core, Hive is made up of just two objects: **Projects **and **Actions. **Many of the Apps and additional pieces of functionality found in Hive, including reporting, center around these concepts. It is important to understand which of the two objects you are talking about when discussing Hive. \\\\n\\\\nEven if you choose to call them something different internally, remember the formal nomenclature here. \\\\n\\\\n## Project\\\\n \\\\nProjects function like folders in the sense that they contain and organize all of your tasks, which are formally known as Action Cards in Hive. Projects are large initiatives or groups of initiatives that can be organized into hierarchies and will contain all the tasks your team needs to do. \\\\n\\\\nThese Projects are visible and accessible on your left-side panel under Project Navigator.\\\\n\\\\nEach project has **unique permissions,** meaning that if a non-Admin user is not added, they do not see it, nor can they access its tasks. As you design your workspace, you will determine what each user can and cannot see. As you add your users, you can even determine whether they have full access rights to create and interact with tasks, or if they can only read them. \\\\n\\\\nEach project also contains an Overview tab where you can define and track: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject Status\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBudgets\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCosts\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nActivity\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAttachments\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRoles (if using Resourcing)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBill / Cost rates (if using Time) \\\\n\\\\nProjects traditionally fall into **two categories** for organizations: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDepartment-level projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nInitiative-level projects\\\\n\\\\nDepartment-level projects are perpetual, meaning they do not have start/end dates, and they constantly ingest work. \\\\n\\\\nInitiative-level projects have set due dates and deadlines. Think of a construction project in this case: all tasks are trending towards an end date, and many may be dependent on each other to begin. \\\\n\\\\nSome examples of these can be seen in the images below. Many teams combine these methods or make their own: \\\\n\\\\n** Department Level Hierarchy: **\\\\n\\\\n** Initiative Level Hierarchy: **\\\\n\\\\nHierarchies, as seen above, help to organize your projects into an easily searchable format. As you build or edit your Project object, changing the Location will determine where the project falls in your hierarchy. T**raditionally, Projects are only created under your hierarchy if they contain 15 or more tasks and run for more than 30 days. **\\\\n\\\\nJust because a user is added to a top level **does not **mean they have access to projects below and vice versa. In the example directly above, clicking Financial Systems Implementations will open a project showing all actions in the 9 projects below. Clicking on New Hampshire Healthcare, however, will only show actions from that specific project. \\\\n\\\\nThe best practice recommendation is to have **no more than 3 layers in your hierarchy**. \\\\n\\\\nMany teams in their first year only have 15-30 projects, but hundreds of action cards. \\\\n\\\\nTo build a hierarchy, when creating or editing a project, select a different location. The name of your workspace will be the default location, but picking an existing project will nest your project underneath. You can find the location bar either by clicking the Project's name when it is open or by clicking the pencil icon when hovering over it in Project Navigator. \\\\n\\\\n## Action Cards\\\\n\\\\nAction Cards, also known as Actions, Cards, or Tasks, are the core element of Hive and the most important object you and your team will be creating. Many long-term teams only have 30 or so projects but thousands of cards. \\\\n\\\\nAction Cards can be as simple or complex as needed. As seen in the example above, I have a relatively in-depth task with multiple assignees and subtasks with subtasks of their own. As a project manager, I add details like labels and dependencies while my employees review and complete their tasks, moving them through various statuses. \\\\n\\\\nAn average assignee will most likely only be viewing what they are being asked to do, moving tasks between statuses, and adding comments/attachments. Project Managers will be looking at the projects holistically and managing labels, task assignment, priority, dependencies, and more. \\\\n\\\\nWhile a project manager may live in Hive, an average employee may only spend 30 minutes a day reviewing their tasks.\\\\n\\\\nAs you bring work into Hive, begin by asking yourself: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIs this complex enough to be a project of its own, or is it just a large task card?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat is my role in Hive? \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat role does my end-user have in all of this?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWho will be creating tasks? Will I be creating all the tasks for my employees upfront, or let them create their own?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat information is needed on my action cards?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I make my action card format repeatable?\\\\n\\\\n### Best Practices Break:\\\\n\\\\nHive is customizable, meaning each user can define how they view the tool. If you want to standardize the experience, make sure to document your decisions \\\\n\\\\nBest practice guidance is to **standardize your approach without restricting your users**, even if multiple departments have different processes. Users respond best to guardrails rather than strict limitations.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow does your organization set up projects?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen are tasks created? What must be included on your tasks? \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDo we have a project hierarchy? If so, what does it look like?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow am I managing project permissions?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat data is most important to my team?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat do I expect of my team and how should they interact with tasks?\\\\n\\\\n# Understanding Hierarchy\\\\n \\\\nProject hierarchy functions as a way to group your projects. A three-layer hierarchy has a grandparent-to-child relation as seen below: \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nProject A (Grandparent Level)\\\\n \\\\nProject B1 (Parent Level)\\\\n \\\\nProject 1C (Child Level) \\\\n\\\\nHive does not contain folders but rather projects inside projects like a nesting doll. Each project is unique in its permissions. Just because a user has access to a Grandparent level does not mean they have access to data in the Parent level and vice versa. \\\\n\\\\nEach of these layers operates as it's own project and contain is own cards. Clicking the Grandparent level, for example, would show you every card in Project A, Project B1, and Project 1C. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, if you click into Project 1C, you will only see tasks made in that project. Hierarchy helps prevent you from having to make multiple clicks when you just want to see all data in one go. Keep these permissions and views in mind when setting up. \\\\n\\\\n# Understanding Projects\\\\n\\\\nAs noted in previous sections, Hive, at its core, is just projects full of tasks. In this section, we will discuss how to best organize and view these tasks. \\\\n\\\\nAt this point, you may have created a project or two, which have a few tabs noting the various views (i.e, List, Status, Table, Gantt) \\\\n\\\\nEach person in your organization learns and works differently. Hive accommodates this by letting teams choose from a large number of project views that users can toggle through to find and interact with their work. \\\\n\\\\nEach Project View comes with its own benefits and many teams choose to standardize their views so users can find their way, no matter where they land using templates. The key takeaways and benefits of the views are listed below and will help you determine which to use for your team. \\\\n\\\\n# Managing the Flow of Work\\\\n\\\\nAs you build your Hive environment, you will also be building and defining the lifecycle of your work. The visual below shows an example of a team's setup for work management. \\\\n\\\\n They define that work comes in through a form submission into a triage project. The team reviews intake and moves the Action Card to an existing project or creates a new project. \\\\n\\\\nAnother team may decide that all work comes in via email and that Project Managers are responsible for inputting it into existing projects. \\\\n\\\\nOnce the projects or actions are in place, the team works toward completion while Management builds reports for monitoring progress. \\\\n\\\\n# Ending Note: User Experience\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, Hive can be as simple or as complex as you would like. It is important, however, to remember your end users. \\\\n\\\\nEnd Users are often the ones juggling multiple tasks on top of updating Hive, so the goal should be making Hive as intuitive and simple as possible. \\\\n\\\\nIf you choose to implement a labeling system, make sure to define it. The same goes for Statuses, Custom Fields, Priorities, and more. \\\\n\\\\nYou may look to save your teams from themselves by restricting the use of the items above. If you have Enterprise Security, consider limiting the creation of Statuses or Labels to Admins under the Enterprise Security settings panel. \\\\n\\\\nKeeping end-user experience in mind will keep your coworkers happy and your environment easy to use. \\\\n\\\\nLooking for more best practice guidance not found here?

Use this guide to get started with setting up your creative workflow in Hive. Let's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Choose your project structure. What is your team type? **\\\\n \\\\n Choose the style closest to you. \\\\n\\\\n## **a) A Marketing & Communications team at a university, institution or organization. **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the Teams / Work streams that you have. For example, you may create work in the following areas and these would each have a project in Hive:\\\\n \\\\nVideo\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEvents\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNewsletters\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBlogs\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPublic Relations: media relations, interviews, press releases\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite content\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite development: Do you maintain more than one domain/site? Make them child projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSocial Media posts: list channels\\\\n\\\\n## **b) A Marketing or Creative team for your company’s product or service **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the major categories of marketing work you produce, for example you may have work in the following categories:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProduct Marketing\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPartnerships\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSales Enablement\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nContent Calendar\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGeneral Marketing (everything else)\\\\n\\\\n## **c) You create deliverables or perform marketing services when requested by your clients**\\\\n \\\\nGreat! Follow-up question here: are you paid for the marketing/creative services? Or, phrased another way - are your clients internal to your organization or are they outside of your organization?\\\\n\\\\n**> If your deliverables are unpaid or clients are internal**\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend that your projects are the **type** of requests you receive from those inside your organization. For instance, let's say you are producing creative marketing materials for real estate agents within your organization. The projects would be the categories of creative work you have, like: Business Cards, New Agent Website, New Listing Postcard, Open House Flyer, Door Hangers. \\\\n\\\\n**> Your deliverables are paid or your clients are external**\\\\n \\\\nCongratulations, you are the traditional 'client based' model for project set-up! We recommend that you create a parent project for each client, and child project is the scope of work, or project sold underneath that client. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Time for a big decision **🤔 - **actions or projects for your work? **\\\\n \\\\nWe are at a fork in the road here! You need to choose if your work is action cards or projects. The rule of thumb is:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project typically takes longer than 30 days or more than 10 major steps, these would usually be **projects. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project is typically shorter than 30 days, or fewer than 10 major steps, the work is usually **action cards. ** \\\\n \\\\nHere's an example of each:\\\\n\\\\n**Action Cards**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, each of the blog articles are on an action card within the Blog Content project. Each blog article has about 5-6 steps and takes a few weeks to complete:\\\\n\\\\n**Projects**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, the website launch has a few components: design, animations, development, QA & user testing and it spans a few months. This makes sense to be its own project.\\\\n\\\\n**Activity: **Create projects in Hive based on the team type & scale recommendation. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Pick your starting point: **how does work usually come to your team?\\\\n \\\\n Pick the option closest to you, but if there are many, it's ok! You can set up each one. \\\\n\\\\n## a) With a request from another team or outside party\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend setting up Hive Forms to manage the intake process. This will standardize the information that your team receives, and eliminate the back-and-forth over email. Once you have your Form created, be sure to share the URL with anyone who makes these requests from you. Putting the link in your email signature is a great idea to promote the new request flow. \\\\n\\\\nReview our Forms Tutorial here and our Video Tutorial here . \\\\n\\\\n## b) With an email request\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you connect Hive Mail, and use the 'Create action from email' option to quickly turn incoming requests into actionable to-dos for your team, slotting them into the correct project and assigning to a team member. \\\\n\\\\n## c) With a weekly, monthly, quarterly planning meeting\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you create a Hive Notes series for this recurring meeting, so you can add a new entry each time the planning meeting occurs, create action items directly form the meeting and put them into your Hive Projects to begin work.\\\\n\\\\nJust start by creating the Hive Note, title it, add an agenda, and share it with attendees of this meeting. The next time this meeting occurs, open the Hive Note & use this for meeting decisions, and action items. \\\\n\\\\n**Activity:** Toggle on Hive Mail, Create Hive Form and/or Create Meeting Note\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Get your supporting apps ready**\\\\n\\\\n## Does your team have creative review cycles? If yes, turn on Proofing & Approvals in Hive Apps\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor internal reviewers, you will be able to route creative work to them as long as they are members of the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor external reviewers - like clients, vendors, partners and others outside of your organization who do not have a Hive license, you will use External Proofing , and you will send them the file using their email address only. \\\\n\\\\n## **Does your team need assistance in Resourcing capacity, keeping track of time or timesheet reporting?

With our step by step guide you can get your campaigns set up ready to go, tracking included. \\\\n\\\\nLet's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: How do your work requests, campaigns or projects begin? Let’s build a seamless work request and briefing system for you.**\\\\n \\\\nWhen initiating projects or campaigns, work generally begins with a brief or request. Create a ** Hive Form ** to capture the request and move away from inconsistent email and duplicate documents. Hive offers you the option of creating an action card in an intake project, ready for triage or creating a project directly from the submission. \\\\n\\\\nTypes of request great for Hive forms:\\\\n \\\\nNew client brief submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative resource or support requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd hoc client requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd Ops Trafficking\\\\n \\\\nHere is an example of a creative resource request and a new campaign brief:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Action card **\\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form is used to collect resource requests for a creative team. The Hive form is creating an action card with the request details for additional resource and landing this in a specific project ready for the triage and assignment:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Project** \\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form collects the briefing information and creates a campaign from a template, ready for the media team to start work. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your Project Navigator and utilise Project Custom Fields for specific campaign information. **\\\\n \\\\nThe project structure must reflect how you organize and execute work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team. \\\\n\\\\nDetermine the structure that’s right for your team by thinking about how the work is structured:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLine of business\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject-based\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign-based\\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create specific guidelines for your Hive users to explain any require naming conventions for your campaigns or projects when applying a template or creating a project. \\\\n\\\\n**Project Custom Fields**\\\\n\\\\nFor custom campaign data that you’d like to track and see displayed on the Project Navigator, project views and included in the Portfolio view, setting up ** Project Custom Fields ** can be incredibly useful. \\\\n\\\\nCampaign data can include:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Budget\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Tier\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient name\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient line of business or product\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSLA details\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nExec Sponsor\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the 'More' menu in the upper right\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create custom field'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType the name of the field you want to add, select the field kind & type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHit 'Save'.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Create a non-campaign or ad-hoc projects to capture tasks outside of your campaigns; support this with a label for easy reporting. **\\\\n \\\\nFrom time to time, tasks and work will occur that is outside of the campaign template. It can help track these for review, assignment or including in your campaign update or QBR with clients.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend creating an Ad Hoc ** project ** where team members can create action cards corresponding to any non-campaign or ad-hoc work requests at a client or channel level. \\\\n\\\\nDoing this will allow you visibility into additional work requests that may be aligned to your organisation’s channels but not specific to any client. At the same time, a client-specific project will give visibility to client-related ad hoc tasks. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create a Hive label that can be applied to all ad-hoc tasks; this will enable you to leverage a Summary view to report all non-campaign tasks across your portfolio. See the next step on how to create labels. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create your labels to categorize work across your campaigns **\\\\n \\\\nWith ** labels **, you can categorize your actions across projects. By creating labels for channels, organization groups, regions or any vital information you would like to group actions and tasks across campaigns or projects, you can easily create a report with a summary view. \\\\n\\\\nLabel data can support:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA Summary View of all work sent to an off-shore hub\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll actions within a specific channel across all campaigns\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll Ad-hoc or non-campaign work-in-progress or complete for a particular client. \\\\n \\\\nJust like an action, you can also create labels with relationships. This gives you more organization and flexibility in categorizing your actions. For example, you may wish to create labels for your channels and group them by region. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Utilize project templates for quick campaign set-up and action templates for processes to support campaign delivery. **\\\\n \\\\n**Project Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** project templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine your campaign plan with the settings, structure and specific steps you need to take in a particular type of campaign or project. Project templates give you the benefit of templating sections, labels, actions, subactions, assignees, custom fields and durations.\\\\n\\\\nRemember that a template has the same qualities as a project, so take advantage and add extras to the template to best represent your campaigns (labels, milestones, etc.) so you can save time once you kick off a live campaign. By including milestones to define KPIs in your template, you will be able to leverage Hive’s Portfolio view and Summary Views to deliver detailed campaign reports based on critical milestones throughout the campaign lifecycle. \\\\n\\\\nProject templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative campaign set-up\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nE2E campaign timelines\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient onboarding projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel Specific campaigns\\\\n \\\\n**Top Tip: **If you have your campaign plan, SLAs or E2E Lifecycle in CSV, it can be quickly uploaded to Hive and ready to go rapidly. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip #2:** Ensure you have a project-level due date on your template that correlates to one of the template’s action due dates. Choose a new due date when applying the template, and all dates will shift according to that date. If no due date is on the template when applied, dates/durations of actions will not carry over. \\\\n\\\\n**How to create a new template**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to the 'Templates' tab on the Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect '+ New Project Template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild the template like you would a project (name, dates, labels, description, attachments, sections)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect who you'd like to share the template with & its permission settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the default layout for the template\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSee the template in the 'Templates' tab\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild out the template as you would a project (you can add actions and subactions and include start and due dates, assignees, labels, etc.) \\\\n\\\\n**Action Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** action templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine the specific steps you need to take in a particular type of task. Applying an action template to an action auto-populates a set of subactions. You can build action templates with labels, assignees, dependencies and ** deadlines **. \\\\n\\\\nAction templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nReports \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative approvals\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nQA rounds\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign briefing \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFinancial reconciliation\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Create your Teams in Hive**\\\\n \\\\nManaging many users is made easy by creating a team in Hive to represent the teams and working groups across your organization. By adding a team to a project every time the team is updated, project members of all projects where the team is a member will be auto-updated. You can add teams to projects, summary views, templates, group chats, comments and tasks within your workspace. This ensures you have the right Hive project members added to the correct campaigns to get to work faster. \\\\n\\\\nHere’s how to create and manage your ** Hive teams **:\\\\n\\\\nTo create a team, go to the \\\\\\\"Manage users\\\\\\\" tab in your workspace settings. You can find this by going to 'Your Profile Dropdown' > 'Manage Users' > 'Teams'. \\\\n \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Teams\\\\\\\" to search existing teams, Edit or Delete existing teams, or create new teams. \\\\n \\\\n**Note:** Only admins or the creator of the team will be able to Edit/Delete teams. \\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"+Create new team\\\\\\\" button will open the following options where you can enter a team name and select workspace members to be part of the team.\\\\n\\\\nTo edit your team click the edit pen icon, and you will be able to amend the membership and name of your team. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n** Summary Views **are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It's handy for managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your client or channel team. A summary view set to table view focused on your client team in Hive or channel label including all projects will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by the due date to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active campaigns to pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Create a Portfolio view to track live campaigns **\\\\n \\\\n** Portfolio View **is the all-in-one place to see the detail set out in Project Navigator combined with a Table View’s flexibility. You have control to build a Portfolio view your way, including Campaigns, Campaign details & Actions; these three building blocks create your portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\nA portfolio view can support live Campaign reporting. When you want to see a picture of all live campaigns for a specific client, including all milestones and project custom fields containing important campaign details, navigate to Portfolio view via your apps menu and start creating your custom portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **You can leverage this view in your status meetings and update the campaign status, description, and other available project information from within the portfolio view. The actions presented enable you to click straight through to the action card and update/review any specific tasks without leaving a portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive and Salesforce Hive 2.0 Template Library Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

We're going to walk through how to configure Hive's Resourcing module, so you can start uncovering these insights and drive some change in your organization!\\\\n\\\\n Note:** It's preferable that you're starting with your projects already created & entered in Hive, so check out one of our other Workflow guides if you haven't completed that step yet! \\\\n\\\\n# ** Step 1: Turn on Resourcing in Hive Apps**\\\\n\\\\nHead to Apps on the left-hand panel and toggle on Resourcing:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Pick your Resourcing \\\\\\\"Zoom Level\\\\\\\" **🔎 :** where do you currently estimate effort for your team's work?**\\\\n \\\\n## Pick which is closest to what your team does.\\\\n\\\\n## a) It's at the task-level - we estimate how long each step in our plan will take, which allows us to be granular.\\\\n \\\\nIn this case, we recommend that Timetracking is also toggled on in Hive Apps so that you can enter estimates onto action cards within your plans. \\\\n\\\\nTo reiterate, task-based estimates are added per person, per action card\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates are usually more granular and are always attached to specific actionable to-dos. Remember actions are things that people can \\\\\\\"do\\\\\\\" & check off their list\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe estimates will follow the project plan, so shifts in the project plan automatically update your Resourcing view\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates appear as guidance for individuals about their allocated time, when they look at My Actions view.\\\\n \\\\nGo to each action card where you want to enter time, and use the Estimates section to add the time. Remember to add the due date to the card, so it will be visible within Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\n**b) If at the Project-level, you will be using resource assignments: estimates are added per person, at the project level.**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis is typically used as broader \\\\\\\"buckets\\\\\\\" of time for blocking out people's availability in assignments when the exact tasks are not known or the level of granularity is too much to maintain for the team\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nResource assignments do not appear in My Actions View - they are not things to be 'completed'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThey do not move with project plan updates\\\\n\\\\nGo to the Resourcing View, and double-click onto the individual's line where you want to add the estimate. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdjust the effort\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the dates\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRemember to confirm! (This sends the user a notification)\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Do you resource by team? **\\\\n \\\\n## Do your team members have assigned teams that you may want to quickly filter to - i.e., show me the Design Team's workload?\\\\n\\\\n**Yes? ** Create teams & set all employees' teams in the Workspace Setting: click on your profile icon, click Settings, navigate to Teams, click the blue \\\\\\\"Create new team\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Does your team have specific roles or special skills?**\\\\n \\\\na) Yes! Great, you can go to the Resourcing Setting, go to People, search for a user, click on their name, and then you'll be able to update the user role or User Tag.\\\\n\\\\nIf you require a user’s role to be modified for a particular project, the Admin or Project Owner can make the necessary adjustments on the Overview page.\\\\n\\\\nb) No, teams is specific enough for my resourcing view. --> No action needed!\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Do you need to allocate time before you know who can take on the work?**\\\\n \\\\nIf so, Placeholders are going to assist in making this possible. A placeholder, like \\\\\\\"Copywriter\\\\\\\" for instance, allows you to assign a task without knowing yet who on your team will take the work. You can see allocations to Placeholders in Resourcing so you know how much work is coming up for a particular team. \\\\n\\\\nTo create Placeholders, head to the More > Settings menu in Resourcing and add from there. \\\\n\\\\nThen, on your projects, select the Placeholders you want to include in that project in the Edit Project Screen:\\\\n\\\\nThen finally, assign the action card to the Placeholder Assignee:\\\\n \\\\n *Note: You can also assign an action card to a Placeholder and a User to an action card! \\\\n\\\\nIf the Estimated time you added exceeds the available hours of the team member who is assigned to this action, you'll be notified that \\\\\\\"This change exceeds <User> availability on <Date>\\\\\\\". User availability is determined based on the user’s Work week hours. This section can be accessed by going to Resourcing > User Profile.\\\\n\\\\nIf the user’s workweek hours are not provided, Hive will utilize the Threshold value specified in the Resourcing settings. In the absence of a Threshold value, Hive will default to the Working day value.\\\\n\\\\n# **Finally, you're ready for the big step **💪 :** Notifying your team of the new resourcing process**\\\\n \\\\nWe think it's best to call a Team Meeting with anyone involved or impacted by the Resourcing workflow (you can always use our guide for Running Great Meetings ). \\\\n\\\\nMake sure you agree on the motions of resourcing your team:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWill you add Estimates & using Placeholders in your Project Templates so you don't need to reinvent the wheel when a new project kicks-off\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow will you deal with overallocation (will people work more hours, or will timelines shift, or will more headcount be required)?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCan everyone see Resourcing, or do you need to restrict visibility for any reason? Review that setting here . \\\\n\\\\n Staffing your team appropriately is both art & science, and we're here to provide the platform to host these great masterpieces! \\\\n Related Articles Time Tracking Quick-Start Guide Using placeholders Adding placeholder resources to projects Resourcing 2.0 - Comprehensive Overview  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"mapped_articles\\\": [\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4752748-plan-execute-company-initiatives\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755427-manage-complex-project-timelines\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5099914-run-a-modern-agency-on-hive\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4684961-produce-creative-work\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755003-run-great-meetings\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5100289-supercharge-your-ad-ops-work-queue\\\"\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n      \\\"course_id\\\": \\\"uc_adops\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Supercharge Ad Ops\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://university.hive.com/uc-adops\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"duration\\\": \\\"25 min\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"level\\\": \\\"Intermediate\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"use_case_guide\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Work queue management, intake, labels, time tracking for ad operations\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"full_guide_content\\\": \\\"Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue \\\\n# Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue\\\\n \\\\nUse Hive forms and action templates to capture and assign a high volume of work requests easily.\\\\n Written by Dee Miller Updated over 4 years ago  \\\\nMedia Operations and Advertising Operations teams deal with a considerable number of tasks originating from various sources across their agency or network, and it can get complicated quickly. Hive can seamlessly support your ticketing, triage and work assignment for trafficking and ad hoc work requests. \\\\n\\\\nBelow, we detail the optimal configuration used by our media agency clients around the globe!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Capture all work requests consistently by creating a Hive form.**\\\\n \\\\nTo ensure you can efficiently capture all work requests across your organization and networked agencies, create a ** Hive form **and land these in a defined project for triage, assignment and labelling relevant to your reporting needs. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** For Hive users within your workspace, pin the form for easy access within the New button menu. For Hive users in other workspaces or external individuals to your organization supply them with a handy URL to take them straight to the form. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example, let’s look at this in practice; in this example, a form has been set up to capture data operations requests. When the request is submitted, Hive lands this in an intake project for review where the action card can be assigned to a team member, the due date populated, and work can begin quickly. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your project navigator to house your work queue. **\\\\n \\\\nIt is vital to ensure that the project structure reflects how your team organizes and executes work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team.\\\\n\\\\nDetermine the suitable structure for you and think about how you manage your work queue, assignments, reporting needs, and stakeholder access to the intake projects. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Nesting projects within Hive enables you to manage focused work request queue while leveraging the parent project to look across all nested projects in one view. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Utilize action card custom fields to tailor the action cards to your needs and turn on action card ID.**\\\\n \\\\nThere will be specific details you will need to capture via the request form, which you will want to include in your task details and your reporting. \\\\n\\\\nSet up your form to populate ** action card custom fields ** to ensure that data is presented to your team members and visible in the table view as a column for easy sorting. \\\\n\\\\nBy turning on the action card ID, you can quickly search for the ID in our search function to find specific task or actions details. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create labels to help categorize your actions**\\\\n \\\\nDo you need to report or segment work requests by department, agency, channel or client? When managing your work requests via an intake project, Hive can help you manage your work queue by leveraging labels. \\\\n\\\\nCreate ** labels ** and nest them into functional groupings to support your teams in quickly applying the correct labels. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **Include your labels on your action templates to help support your tracking. The action template can be applied when a request is submitted to ensure that you have all the correct information to hand as soon as the request arrives in your queue. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Create an action template to populate recurring actions, deadlines, labels and assignments**\\\\n \\\\nTo quickly get your teams to work, template recurring tasks that should be followed for each work request with an ** action template .** \\\\n\\\\nThis enables you to add relevant labels, automatically assign work to team members, ensure ** deadlines ** are presented correctly in line with your SLA and provide a consistent workflow for progress reporting and work capacity management. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Set up custom status in the status view to reflect the stages of your workflow**\\\\n \\\\nA custom ** status ** can reflect specific stages in your workflow; on Hold, With Client, or QA are helpful examples of custom status that can be employed to help report on the status of work and communication with project teams. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Connect Hive mail to quickly follow up on form submissions**\\\\n \\\\n** Hive mail ** enables you to attach email strings to existing work requests to support fast follow-ups, confirmations and proactively seeing additional information to help workflow smoothly. You can create an email, reply or forward emails directly from within your action card.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Consider Card priorities level options to help your teams prioritize work requests.**\\\\n \\\\nWant to make sure your teams address high priority items first? Utilize ** Priority Levels ** in Hive and customize it to meet your specific needs. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 9: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n Summary Views are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It is beneficial for traffickers, managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your queue. A summary view set to status view focused on your team in Hive, including all projects, will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by label and priority to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active tasks and pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive Forms Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

(Is your team more Low, Medium, High? Or perhaps P1, P2, P3, P4? - it's your choice!) \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSort action cards by Priority level in your project's card layouts\\\\n\\\\n# How to get started: Toggle on the Hive App\\\\n \\\\n**Step 1: **Toggle on Card priorities in Hive Apps. Note: A workspace Admin must enable this! \\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: **Check out your new feature: open any action card to see the defaults: High, Medium and Low as shown in the screenshot below. If that works for you, you're all set! If you'd like to customize it, continue reading to the next section. \\\\n\\\\n# Customize your Priorities\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend starting by using the edit option to change the name & color of the 3 existing priorities and adding a fourth or more using the \\\\\\\"Add a new priority level' option. Click the Edit pencil when hovering over the priority to get started:\\\\n\\\\n You can customize:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nName \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLevel (when you sort, 1 will be at the top)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nColor\\\\n\\\\n# View & Sort your Priorities:\\\\n \\\\n## Card Layouts\\\\n \\\\nFrom a card layout, click **Filters,** and then under Sort's **Order by** drop-down, choose Priority Level. The cards will be ordered with Level 1 at the top, descending from there.\\\\n\\\\n## Priority Levels & Urgency\\\\n \\\\nWhen sorted by Priority Level, if you have an action card marked as Urgent, the Urgent card will be ranked at the top, even if its Priority Level is lower than another card. After the Urgent card, the rest of the cards will be listed by their Priority Level (and cannot be re-ordered differently). \\\\n\\\\n## **Table View**\\\\n \\\\nFrom Table view, show the Priority column and then click on the top of the column to sort in Priority order:**​\\\\n\\\\n# Common Questions\\\\n\\\\n## Q: Are priorities workspace-wide? Will they be the same on ALL action cards in the workspace? **\\\\n \\\\nA: Once toggled on, Card Priorities will be shown on **all** action cards across the workspace and will appear the **same** in the drop-down list across all action cards & projects. \\\\n\\\\n## ** Q: Can I see priorities in Table View? What about sorting by Priority in Table View? **\\\\n \\\\nA: Yes!

Action templates can help you quickly update tasks that tend to repeat throughout your projects and keep consistency across the workspace.\\\\n \\\\nAdditionally, these templates can also be automatically applied using forms or project settings for more streamlined workflows.\\\\n\\\\n# To create an action template:\\\\n \\\\nGo to your main menu (upper right corner)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Settings\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Templates\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nMake sure you are in the \\\\\\\"Action Card\\\\\\\" menu\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Create action template\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nName the template and provide a label if desired\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the subactions, assignees, days, and durations. It will look something like the below. You can add further levels of subactions onto your action templates too!\\\\n \\\\nThen you just save the action template and you're done!\\\\n \\\\n You can also create an action template straight from an action card, using the 'Save as template' option underneath the More menu on the right:\\\\n\\\\n# Setting due dates on action templates\\\\n \\\\nTo ensure deadlines are included when you apply an action template, make sure that the 'Automatically add due dates' option is checked. ​\\\\n \\\\n We will refer to the image above for the examples below \\\\n\\\\nAssuming you've used positive and negative deadlines, there are two different scenarios to which deadlines will be applied:\\\\n\\\\n## 1. If your main action card already has a deadline set, at the moment that you apply the action template:\\\\n \\\\nSince you have already applied the deadline to the action, Hive is smart to know that you need to complete the action by that specific date. Hive will set any subaction in your action template that is listed as 'Day 0' as equal** to the parent action due date. \\\\n\\\\nAll negative days will happen before the action due date and all positive days will happen after the action due date, following the same pattern.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the above example for the Blog Post action template, if you have **set** the action card's deadline to 15 Jan **before** applying the template, when you apply the Blog Post action template:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Draft\\\\\\\" will be set for 13 Jan (minus 2 days before 15 Jan) \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Review\\\\\\\" will be set for 14 Jan (minus 1 day before 15 Jan)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Finalize & Post\\\\\\\" will be set for 15 Jan (Day 0)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Analyze Post Traffic\\\\\\\" will be set for 21 Jan (plus 6 days after 15 Jan)\\\\n \\\\n## 2. If your action does not currently have a deadline set when you apply the action template:\\\\n \\\\nSince you have enabled deadlines and your action currently has no deadline, Hive assumes that the subaction marked as 'Day 0' in the action template is today.\\\\n\\\\nUsing the above example for the Blog Post action template, if today is 17 Dec:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Draft\\\\\\\" will be set for 15 Dec (minus 2 days before today)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Review\\\\\\\" will be set for 16 Dec (minus 1 day before today)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Finalize & Post\\\\\\\" will be set for 17 Dec (today)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n\\\\\\\"Analyze Post Traffic\\\\\\\" will be set for 23 Dec (6 days after today)\\\\n\\\\n# Adding dependencies to the template\\\\n \\\\nNot only can you automatically add deadlines, you can also set up dependencies . So if one step can't move forward without the completion of another, it can be useful to set one up. \\\\n\\\\nJust click the \\\\\\\"Add dependency\\\\\\\" link. It will open a search box where you type the name of the step you want this step to be dependent on and select add. It will then show the dependency in bright yellow with the option to remove. \\\\n\\\\n# Adding approval rounds to the template\\\\n \\\\nIf your action will need an approval process, you can include an approval template within your action template. ( Note: you will need to first save the approval template by setting up the approval round and clicking Save as template under the More menu ).\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have the approval template, you can add it to your action template here towards the bottom of the modal.\\\\n\\\\n# Adding an action template to a card\\\\n \\\\nBefore applying an action template, you can also manually create action cards. Navigate to the project workspace, click on the **New (+)** button in the toolbar, and customize your action card for the specific needs of your project.\\\\n \\\\nClick the blue + New button next to the search bar to create a new action card, then select \\\\\\\"Apply Template\\\\\\\" under the More menu towards the right.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the searchable popup, click the name of the template you would like to apply. It will create the subactions and add the assignees, due dates, and dependencies from your template.\\\\n\\\\n# Adding multiple action templates to a card\\\\n \\\\nYou can now layer multiple action templates on a single action card. To do so:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nApply the first action template to the card. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect a second action template from the dropdown list.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHive will add in all of the subactions, due dates, assignees, and attachments from the second action template. All data from the first template will also remain! \\\\n \\\\n# Applying action template to multiple actions at once\\\\n \\\\nIf you want to apply the same template to actions in bulk, you can do it in Table view. All you have to do is to select actions, right-click and select 'Apply action template'. \\\\n \\\\nAlternatively, action templates can be pre-applied to cards using the \\\\\\\"Use action template\\\\\\\" option in project settings. Configure this to automatically apply templates to new cards created via forms, ensuring consistency and saving time.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Action Template — Deadlines New this Week in Hive: June 2021 New This Week in Hive: August 2021 New This Week in Hive: November 2021 New This Week in Hive: December 2021  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 5782\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"project_views\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Project Views & Layouts\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"7 interchangeable views: Status View (Kanban boards), Label View (tag-based grouping), Calendar View (date-based), Gantt View (timeline with dependencies), Table View (spreadsheet-like), Team View (by assignee), List View (filterable list with sections).\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 2,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 13445,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Project Layouts (All 6 Views)\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/511650-project-layouts\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Project layouts | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects Project layouts \\\\n# Project layouts\\\\n \\\\nThe 7 types of layouts and when you should use each\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over a year ago  \\\\nHive offers 7 different ways to view a Hive project and this will give you an overview of each:\\\\n \\\\n Status view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Team view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Calendar \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Label view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Gantt chart \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Table view \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n List view \\\\n \\\\nWithin the project, you can toggle between the views at any time** and even have **multiple people in the same project each working in a different layout**. Everyone will see the information and **updates in real-time, no matter which layout** they are in!\\\\n\\\\nEach layout can be helpful depending on what your team is working on and how you like to organize your work.  So how do you know which one to choose?\\\\n\\\\nIn this article, we'll provide guidance on the pros and cons of each layout. So that the next time you make a project you can choose your layout with confidence. \\\\n\\\\n# **1. Status view**\\\\n \\\\n In status view, all of your project's action cards are organized in lists that each represent a \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\" in your workflow. Your actions move horizontally across the lists from unstarted to completed. You can customize the status columns to fit your team's exact specifications. \\\\n\\\\n**When is status view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you prefer a **visual workflow**, status view lets you see at a glance the progress of a project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf the actions in your project **all go through the same statuses**, it makes a lot of sense to use a status view.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your team uses **Agile methods**, status view is best suited to organizing and managing sprints.\\\\n \\\\nThose are just a few of the instances status view can be useful. In terms of downsides, status view doesn't emphasize deadlines as much as other views, and it can be a little more difficult to break it down by team member or label. \\\\n\\\\n**A note on statuses:**\\\\n\\\\nAs mentioned above, actions in status view move horizontally from one list to another. The default set of statuses is unstarted -> in progress -> completed. However, you can add new statuses to completely customize how your project is organized. The easiest way to add a status is to scroll over to the right of your project, add the name of your status in the text box, and press enter.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some examples of sets of statuses that your team could use:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Blog publishing** - unstarted -> ideas -> writing -> editing -> add images -> published -> share on social media -> completed\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Agile sprint** - unstarted -> this week -> in progress -> needs review -> completed\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Hiring funnel **- unstarted -> reviewed application -> selected for phone interview -> phone interview scheduled -> selected for on-site interview -> on-site interview scheduled -> hired -> completed\\\\n\\\\n# **2. Team view**\\\\n \\\\n In team view, all your actions are organized under columns with each list representing a team member.  You can reassign actions to other team members with a simple drag and drop, and add new actions onto someone's list with ease. \\\\n\\\\n**When is team view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIt's great for managers who want an easy way to **assess team workload**.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf actions often move from one person to another, it is super **easy to move actions between team members** in team view.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou can keep from putting too much on people's list by **adding tasks to the unassigned** column. That way the first person to have some free time can pick it up by dragging it onto their list. \\\\n \\\\nThese are just a few reasons of why having a team view can help you move your project forward.\\\\n\\\\nTeam view is not as helpful if you need to see the status of your actions or if you are working on a project by yourself.\\\\n\\\\n# **3. Calendar view**\\\\n \\\\n In calendar view , you can see all the actions in your project organized by deadline. You can simply drag and drop to change an action's deadline. The default view shows all actions due for the next six weeks. \\\\n\\\\n Hive calendar also allows you to **one-way sync **to Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCal. \\\\n\\\\n**When is calendar view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want your team to **focus on deadlines**, a calendar makes it easy to keep them top of mind.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want to be able to **view your actions on your email calendar **as well, this view is the only one that allows you to do that. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want **all the actions you add to have deadlines**, it's super easy to do on the calendar. You can just click the date and it automatically opens a task with that deadline. \\\\n \\\\nCalendar view is awesome! The only cases where it's not as useful are when you want to be able to view key details of your actions on the front of the card. In calendar view, only the title and the assignee of the action shows. It's also harder to see who on your team is working on what for the same reason. \\\\n\\\\n# **4. Label view**\\\\n \\\\n In label view, all your actions are organized under lists with each list representing a different label.  You can change the label of an action with a simple drag and drop, and add new actions to a label with ease. \\\\n\\\\nLabels in Hive are essential tags you can add to action cards that make it easier to distinguish between different actions in a project. \\\\n\\\\n**When is label view helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your **team uses several labels**, this layout can be a great way to assess your workflow across initiatives.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you want to **easily add labels to new actions **you create, all you have to do is type in an action in the text box of the label you want to add.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your team prefers a **visual workflow**, it helps that each action comes with a color that can make it easier spot the differences between them.\\\\n \\\\nLabel view is not as helpful if your team doesn't really use labels or you want to be able to easily see who is responsible for an action. \\\\n\\\\n# **5. Gantt Chart**\\\\n \\\\n In Gantt, all your actions are laid out in a chart where each line represents something you want to do. These actions correspond to dates where the start and endpoint of the action represents the timeline it is expected to be completed. You can drag and drop to change the timeline and simply click to add a new action.  \\\\n\\\\nGantt charts includes the ability to zoom into to take a closer look and add dependencies when needed.\\\\n\\\\n**When is Gantt Chart helpful?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you are trying to plan out how long a project will take, Gantt is a perfect way to assess that.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you have a clear understanding of the steps involved in completing the goal, it is really easy to lay out in a chart form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you need to be able to share your plan with people outside your organization, Gantt allows you to export your work to PDF, PNG or XLS.\\\\n \\\\nGantt view is so great for planning, but not as useful if you run in an agile framework where you never really can predict specific timelines.\\\\n\\\\n# **6. Table View**\\\\n \\\\n In Table View, all your actions are laid out in a table (like a spreadsheet). These actions can be sorted and filtered accordingly to your needs and preferences. You can easily edit the text or change the fields by clicking on it.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n Additionally, you can use filters on the column titles to filter many of the actions. Columns can be re-arranged or toggled on and off for your preferences. \\\\n\\\\nWhen is Table View useful?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you are to do a multiple sort/filter. Say you want to see all actions that are unstated but overdue, you can do so quickly and flexibly in Table View.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you want to see a list of actions and make changes quickly. In table View, you can edit the field by clicking on it. \\\\n \\\\nTable View is so great for quick editing and filtering. However, it is important to know that first-time users may feel overwhelmed by Table View. Know that a table view is useful when you know exactly what you want. \\\\n\\\\n# **7. List View**\\\\n \\\\nOur newest Project Layout List View brings the convenience of a list (think My Actions View, but for any project) with customizable filters. Think: one expanded list of all actions in your project that can be customized, filtered, and edited to fit your workflow, preferences, and needs.\\\\n\\\\nLike Table View, List View columns with Status, Labels, etc, will all be editable directly from the column themselves. This will allow users to quickly alter or change small task items as needed without going into the action card itself.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive Projects Summary Views Export project plans Share read-only project link Project Creation and Management FAQs  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 8508\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"List View\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/8907936-list-view-a-new-project-view-in-hive\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"List View: A New Project View in Hive | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects List View: A New Project View in Hive \\\\n# List View: A New Project View in Hive\\\\n Written by Michaela Rollings Updated over 4 months ago  \\\\nThis week we're launching List View,** and it's not every day we launch a brand new project view. \\\\n\\\\nWith this new view, we're bringing the convenience of a list into your Hive projects - if you like Home View, this will be your new favorite.\\\\n\\\\nThink: one expanded list of all actions in your project that can be customized, filtered, and edited to fit your workflow, preferences, and needs. \\\\n\\\\n**​\\\\n \\\\nTo access List View and test it out for yourself, just create a new tab with our swanky new tabs feature and select List View. \\\\n\\\\nIf you want this List View to be private, just slide the \\\\\\\"Private view\\\\\\\" toggle on the bottom of the dropdown.\\\\n\\\\nAt the top right, you'll find the Configure view settings:**\\\\n \\\\n Group By section : by default, the List view will be organized by Status, but with a few clicks, you can configure the list view to group by:\\\\n \\\\nStatus\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSection\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPriority Level\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject/subproject\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPhase\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Filter section: provides a variety of different filters such as Statuses, Assignees, Dates, Labels, etc.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Display section: \\\\n \\\\nColumns: One of the ways to select which columns to display.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBlocked actions: Blocked / Unblocked / Show both\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nMilestones: Milestone / No Milestone / Show both\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nArchived actions check box\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProjects in draft mode check box\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEmpty groups check box: if your Section/Project/Status, etc doesn't have any actions under it, you'll want to check this box to allow Hive to show that empty Section/Project/Status in your view.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUnbundle subactions: Do not show subactions unless they're grouped under parent actions\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHide subactions: Do not show subactions when they're not grouped under parent actions\\\\n \\\\nBringing special attention to Sections.

You've found it.\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over a year ago  \\\\nWelcome!  You’ve landed in the right spot to get Hive set up the way you want to work.  \\\\n\\\\nHive takes everything your team needs - quick chat, tasks, projects, and files - and puts them on one dashboard.  Together, with the power of flexible views so you can work the way you want, and predictive data to track upcoming issues, Hive is working just as hard as you are to keep your projects on track.   \\\\n\\\\nThis article will take you through the most important milestones in getting set up, but if you're looking for a quick tutorial - check out this Hive 101 Overview: \\\\n\\\\nReady to go?   Create your Hive account , and get started with the steps below.   ​\\\\n\\\\n# 1. Enter your first tasks\\\\n \\\\nStart by entering a few tasks on your own My Actions list, by using the blue +New ** button in the top right, and enter at least 3 tasks for upcoming work you have to complete. Select a due date and check them out on the **My Actions** tab along the left navigation bar.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen you created those actions, did you notice all the possible details you can add to the action card? We recommend to start simple, but when you're ready - there are some powerful ways to manage tasks:\\\\n\\\\nDon't forget - that blue **+New** button, then select 'Action' is the place to assign actions to your team as well.  **​\\\\n\\\\n# 2. Rally your team\\\\n \\\\nNow it's time to think about who will need access to Hive so that they can be be assigned work, comment and collaborate, attach files, review progress, move projects forward to the next stage, and close them out.  \\\\n\\\\n Add your co-workers. ** For primary members of the workspace who have access to multiple projects - invite them in using email, and selecting which projects they should see - simply using the **+Invite** button next to +New action button:\\\\n\\\\n**Organize everyone.**  If your co-workers are organized into departments or teams, you'll want to add that team structure to Hive so you can more easily add them to projects, and specifically @mention a team in chat groups and comments.  You can find the Teams section from your profile menu (your avatar in the top right), then under Workspace settings choose **Settings **or **Manager users**.  \\\\n\\\\n**Include any external users. ** Collaborate with freelancers or work closely with clients or vendors?  Add them as an external user .   They will have access to a single project, and its associated chat group, if one exists.  Click to that **External User** tab as shown in the above screenshot, to add an External User to one project.  **​\\\\n\\\\n# 3. Start collaborating\\\\n \\\\nNow that you have a few tasks on your own to-do list (My Actions), and invited your colleagues and organized them into teams, let's start entering projects.\\\\n\\\\n Ready to go?****Head to Project Navigator , click +New Project** button, and enter a name.  You'll see options underneath for some optional fields:\\\\n\\\\nDue date -  flag to the team when the project is expected to be completed or launched. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLocation - you can make this project a child or sub to a parent project or just create a project on its own.  We recommend making Parent projects if you have many client projects under the same client, or you have departments, and sub-projects underneath each department in your organization.\\\\n \\\\nOn the next screens you'll pick the layout , and decide on the sharing permissions.  \\\\n\\\\nWith the project created, start collaborating with your team:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDo you have repeatable steps in your workflow?  Set up action templates . \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Post a comment on an action card to keep conversation in context of the task at hand\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n@mention your teammates to call their attention quickly to your question or comment\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCheck your Notifications feed - (look for the bell icon in the top right) - it's your command central for tasks and items that need your attention.  You can always choose when and how you get notified, too.  \\\\n \\\\n**Need inspiration?****What type of work does your team do, and what's your primary goal for using Hive? We power many teams - and have several examples of marketing, product development, software development, human resources, content marketing, and branding/client project setups.  If you haven't already added those project templates during the on-boarding screens, send us a message and let us know what template you're looking for, and our Customer Success team will be in touch.\\\\n\\\\n# Final Steps & Power-Ups:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Get the apps.**  Make sure to download the Hive apps so you can create tasks, respond to comments, and chat to your colleagues on the go, and our desktop apps for Mac or PC.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Setup your integrations.**  Check out our available integrations through Zapier.  \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Join a webinar. ** Sign up for our next webinar \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Ask us anything.  **Use the blue question mark in the top right of the app to reach us, or visit our Help Center for more detailed articles.  \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Personalize it!** Finally, don't forget to add your company logo to Hive\\\\n \\\\n ​ ​\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Staff your projects Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue Hive Best Practices  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 5362\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Understanding Hive's Platform\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/1519397-understanding-hive-s-platform\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Understanding Hive's Platform | Hive Help \\\\n• **    Getting Started Getting to know Hive Understanding Hive's Platform \\\\n# Understanding Hive's Platform\\\\n \\\\n15 seconds introduction to the Hive dashboard\\\\n A Written by Alexander Heldring Updated over 2 weeks ago \\\\nWelcome to the Hive dashboard!

In the right column** you’ll see who is assigned to the action, when it’s due, and what the card’s status is. \\\\n\\\\nIf you'd like the action card to appear as an event in your Google/Outlook Calendar, you can use the 'Schedule time' option under the Dates section in the card. To make the 'Schedule time' option appear, you'll make sure you have Hive Calendar connected in your Hive Apps. \\\\n\\\\nThe pop-out will show your Calendar availability, including existing events and you'll be able to choose a suitable time slot. The event will appear in your Calendar with the same name as the action card title.\\\\n\\\\nTo schedule an event for both you and your teammate/-s, you can add them to the guest list. Hive will then show the full Calendar availability of each team member you add – making it easier than ever before to schedule time for meetings, check-ins, and more!\\\\n\\\\nUse the following options to easily add your event data to the action card as well:\\\\n \\\\nAdd to estimated time - add event time duration to the Estimated time section on the card;\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd users as assignees - set all guests as assignees on the card;\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSet as action due date - use the event date as a new due date for your action card.\\\\n\\\\n**Note**: this feature works for both Google & Outlook Calendars, however, Outlook users can only schedule time for their own calendar, not search for others' availability.\\\\n\\\\nThe** top bar** of the action card tells you which project it’s in, and the bar’s color represents the project color. **Move the card **to a new project by clicking on the caret next to the project’s name. \\\\n\\\\nTo mark your card as **urgent**, access action templates , convert your action, or use other great features, head over to the 'More' menu at the top right of the card.\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that it's possible to change your action's status color. All you need to do is open up the Statuses dropdown and hit the pencil icon next to the Status you want to change the color for.** **\\\\n\\\\n**Note: since this is a global setting, the color will be changed in every action card with that status in your workspace. Keep this in mind when changing common statutes like \\\\\\\"In Progress\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Completed\\\\\\\".**\\\\n\\\\nQuickly share, delete, archive, or add followers to your action from the bottom right of the card. \\\\n\\\\n Following the card means you will get notifications in your activity feed for things like comments, status updates, and date changes. Assignees will automatically become followers. **​ Use the comments section on the bottom left of the card to collaborate with your teammates. When you @mention someone, they will automatically be added as a follower. You can use the @action and @project shortcuts to automatically send a direct mention notification to all action card followers, and all project members, respectively. \\\\n\\\\nTo see the history **of your card, click on the 'Show history' option at the bottom left of the card. ​\\\\n\\\\nFinally, if you would like to adjust the Hive Apps that are visible on your action cards, head to the Edit Project menu (More > Edit Project > Advanced settings) and select which Apps should appear for this project:\\\\n\\\\nNote: the options available will depend on which Hive Apps you have turned on or connected in your workspace.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Create a Jira issue from Hive New This Week in Hive: August 2021 New This Week in Hive: October 2021 New This Week in Hive: November 2021 Adding Holidays & OOO Calendars into Hive  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3868\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Project Navigator\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/592728-project-navigator\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Project Navigator | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects Project Navigator \\\\n# Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\nNavigate between all of your active and archived projects\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 7 months ago  \\\\nProject Navigator makes it easy to view, edit, and access all of the projects you're working on. \\\\n\\\\n## Accessing Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\nTo access the Project Navigator, click the 'Project Navigator' page from the left panel of the app. \\\\n\\\\n## Using Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\nIt will open a panel that shows a list of all the projects you have been added to in Hive. If you're looking for a particular project, you can search for it using the search bar.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to see which projects you're a member of, you should go to My Projects tab. \\\\n\\\\nYou can see certain project information at a glance and control which columns (like the name of each project, the team members involved, the status, start and end dates, budget and project custom fields) are displayed for each project. Use the 'Manage columns' button on the right-hand side of Project Navigator to control these columns. You can also sort the columns to make it easier for you to navigate through your projects.\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to filter your projects by a project custom field value, this is something you can do as well. You need to hover over a custom field column and click the Filter icon.

Click it again if you'd like to remove it from the favorites section. \\\\n\\\\n# More Menu\\\\n \\\\nIf you want to drill into a project without navigating away from whatever view you are on, you can use the More Menu. It allows you to:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen a project in a new tab \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUnpin the project from your left sidebar\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nArchive the project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDelete the project.\\\\n \\\\nTo access it, simply hover over the desired app/project, right click on the three dots icon near the project, and choose the needed option.

This could include employee salaries, private client information, or personal projects. \\\\n\\\\nThat's why Hive has projects!\\\\n\\\\nEvery task created in Hive projects is completely self-contained and can only be seen by the project members. \\\\n\\\\nThat way you can share a workspace, but protect certain sensitive information or just make sure others aren't distracted by information irrelevant to them.\\\\n\\\\nHere's how:\\\\n\\\\n## Click the Project Navigator\\\\n\\\\nThis button takes you to the page where you can manage all your projects.\\\\n\\\\n## Click the \\\\\\\"+New Project\\\\\\\" button\\\\n \\\\nOnce you arrive in the Project Navigator, you can click the blue button in the upper left corner of the screen that says \\\\\\\"+New Project.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n## Choose how you want to create a new project\\\\n \\\\nChoose if this new project will be a blank project, created from a template, or created by importing a file.\\\\n \\\\nThen give your project a name and pick a color you want to be associated with your project. \\\\n\\\\n## Add team members\\\\n \\\\nThe team members you select for your project are the ONLY people who can see it.

Submitted forms have the option to automatically create an action card in Hive with all the form details. ​ Some great uses for Hive forms can include:\\\\n \\\\ncollecting orders or requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nsubmitting bugs and other issues\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\ngathering structuring information from employees (e.g. contact info)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\ncapturing details for a new project request\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nand much more!\\\\n\\\\n# How to create:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnable \\\\\\\"Forms\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\"Hive Apps\\\\\\\" if it's not already enabled\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Forms\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Create new form\\\\\\\" from the Forms Library page\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nAdd a title and description\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDrag and drop the fields you want to add to the form\\\\n \\\\nThere are multiple different question type options and dynamic fields you can add to a Hive form. \\\\n\\\\nBelow are example questions that can be created using a Hive form:\\\\n\\\\n Checkbox Group  \\\\n\\\\n Date Field \\\\n\\\\n *Users can choose Min Date, Max Date/Min Date and Max Date to configure what dates a user can select from the form, this setting can be found in the edit modal for the Date Field in Forms. \\\\n\\\\n File Upload (can support any type of file) \\\\n\\\\n Header \\\\n\\\\n Paragraph \\\\n\\\\n Radio Group \\\\n\\\\n Text Field (Single or paragraph) \\\\n\\\\n Text Area \\\\n\\\\n Ruler \\\\n\\\\n Multi-text \\\\n\\\\nDepending on which field you choose, you have the option to make it required, add help text, set a max character length, and other customizations.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Add confirmation message**\\\\n \\\\nThis is the message that the person will see after they submit the form.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Set where you want to submit the form **\\\\n\\\\n# **Form Statuses **\\\\n \\\\nTo better control form versions and updates without losing prior submission data, we have three form statuses: **Draft, Published, and Archived.**\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Draft** - This is where you work on designing, editing, or testing a form before it's ready for use.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOnce you've made updates to your form or created a draft of it, selecting \\\\\\\"**Save**\\\\\\\" saves the form and maintains the ** Draft ** state. This means the edits you've made will ** not ** be published.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelecting the \\\\\\\"**Publish**\\\\\\\" button saves the changes and allows the updated form to be displayed for members in the workspace.**​ ​\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll users can see a Draft Form in the Form Library, but it can only be published by the form owner or an Admin.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf a member of your team opens a link to a Draft Form, they will get a message indicating this form is under construction and cannot be submitted.\\\\n\\\\n2. Published**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOnce your form is ready to go live, selecting \\\\\\\"**Publish**\\\\\\\" will both** save and publish **the latest version of the form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll members of your team can see published forms.\\\\n\\\\nCurious how to switch the form from Published back to Draft?**​\\\\n \\\\n As an Admin or form owner, ** you might decide the form needs modifications made in the Draft status. To unpublish the form, navigate to the three dots menu at the top of the screen to Mark it as draft.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Archived**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nArchive/Unarchive options in the form are only available for form owner and Admins. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf a member of your team opens a link to the Archived Form, they will get the same message as above indicating the form is unavailable.\\\\n\\\\n# **Pinning your Form: Individually vs Workspace pinning****\\\\n \\\\nThis allows quick access to forms you use on a day-to-day basis or find yourself frequently using. \\\\n \\\\n If everyone in the workspace does not have the same go-to forms, you can pin a form for yourself only **in your Personal Form Library. Individually pinned forms will sit at the top of the Library and remain in the same position just for you (similar to pinning Notes and Projects).\\\\n\\\\nIf you prefer to pin a form ** for all workspace members, ** you can use 'shortcuts'. When a form shortcut is created, all users can access it via the 'New' dropdown in Hive.\\\\n\\\\n# **Determine where the submitted forms should route**\\\\n \\\\nOnce someone has submitted a form, the data can go to a few places.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n** Hive Action ** - Selecting the 'Create new action from form submission' option will automatically create an action card in Hive in a designated project and assign the action to the person(s) you select. It will look like this:\\\\n \\\\n# Creating Actions Directly Under Specific Sections\\\\n \\\\nTo create an action directly under a specific section in a Hive project when a form is submitted, use the Hive Workflows app. Follow these steps:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Set Up a Workflow**: Open the Hive Workflows app and create a new workflow.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Define the Trigger**: Set the trigger to activate when an action is created in your desired project via a form submission.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Configure the Section Update**: Adjust the workflow settings to automatically update the section of the newly created action, ensuring it is placed under the correct section in your project.\\\\n \\\\nThis setup allows you to organize newly created actions directly under specific project sections, improving project structure and management.\\\\n\\\\n** 1.1. Hive Sub-Action ** - Selecting the 'Create new action from submission' option and choosing a parent action card will automatically create a sub-action card under the parent action card.\\\\n\\\\nThe sub-action will look like this:\\\\n\\\\n1.2.** Create another new action from form submission ** - Selecting the \\\\\\\"Create another new action from form submission\\\\\\\" option will create a separate action in another project/assigned to another user/ etc.**​ Another optional but great way is to use the \\\\\\\"Only create this action IF\\\\\\\" condition and set specific criteria for your form submissions. ​\\\\n\\\\n 2. Project ** - Selecting the 'Create new project submission' option will automatically create a new project each time the form is submitted. On the edit page of each question, you can designate the question selections to be mapped to the new project description and/or project custom fields areas.\\\\n\\\\n** 2.1. Update an existing project from the form submission ** - Selecting this option will make the submission completely update the existing project according to the information entered in the request. On the edit page of each question, you can designate the question selections to be mapped to the exsiting project description and/or project custom fields areas.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNote: Form submissions cannot update the description of an existing action card. Instead, new action cards are generated. Use custom field mappings for better data integration.\\\\n\\\\n For additional settings, open the **\\\\\\\"Settings panel\\\\\\\"** at the bottom of the page. \\\\n \\\\n# Common Use Cases and Best Practices\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Project Organizing**: Use workflows to automatically place tasks in appropriate sections for better team visibility.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Data Structuring**: Leverage custom field mapping to capture key form details precisely where needed in your templates.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Troubleshooting**: Ensure your workflows are correctly triggered by testing with sample form submissions and verifying task placement.\\\\n \\\\nBy following these guidelines, you can maximize the utility of Hive Forms and streamline your project setups.\\\\n\\\\n** Email submitter ** - Selecting the 'Each time a form is submitted, send a copy to the form submitter' option will send an email with all of the entered information to the person who filled out the form.\\\\n\\\\n**​ Require Hive sign-in **- Selecting the 'Require sign-in for form submissions' option will require those submitting the form to sign into Hive in order to submit the form.\\\\n\\\\n** Permission Settings ** - Selecting the 'Only admins and form creator can edit' option restricts editing to the form creator and admins.\\\\n\\\\n# **Preview a form**\\\\n \\\\nThe new Form Builder allows users to preview what Forms will look like when sent externally. At the top of the page, select \\\\\\\"Preview\\\\\\\" to view the Form.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also customize preview settings to ensure correct formatting from different devices (iPhone, Desktop, etc.). Click the computer icon in the top right corner and a list of devices will populate.\\\\n\\\\n# **Sharing the form Externally**\\\\n \\\\nEach form comes with a link that you can share or post on a website. \\\\n\\\\nTo access the link, on the Forms Library page click the 'Copy URL' button to save it to your clipboard where you can then post it where you would like.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a person clicks on the form, they will be taken to a web page that looks something like this.\\\\n\\\\nThere they can fill out and submit their information.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"Form\\\\\\\" feature is definitely an awesome way to get things done!**​ ​\\\\n \\\\n# Internal vs. External form title\\\\n \\\\nTeams often have an internal naming convention for their forms, making it easier for internal teammates to identify and use them, but want to add a clear title for external people filling out the form. So, let's dive into the details! ​ To bridge this communication gap, you can add an External title right under the Internal one. The external title will be visible for form submitters.\\\\n\\\\n# Rich text in the form fields\\\\n \\\\nTo make it easier to highlight important or significant information, we have added the ability to format text in forms by using hotkeys. With this feature, you can now bold, italicize, and underline text within any text field answers. The formatting you apply in the forms will also carry over to Hive to the completed card/project.\\\\n\\\\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to use:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen a form\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd text area / single input / multi-text field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSave the form\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen it to submit\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType some text\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect it and hit Ctrl/Command + B/I/U keys.\\\\n\\\\n# Automatically save form drafts\\\\n \\\\nNow user's entries in the form will no longer disappear even if you leave the form! Here is some information on how the form's draft works!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAny fields filled out in a form are saved automatically when you close the form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you re-open the form in the same browser on the same device, the answers you had previously filled out will still be there.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAttachments will not ** be saved, so if you re-enter the form, the attachment will need to be uploaded again.\\\\n \\\\n# Duplicating Form Questions\\\\n \\\\nUsers will be able to duplicate the question in the form by clicking on the Duplicate button in the Form Editor!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAny Logic that was placed in the question will carry over.\\\\n\\\\n# Enable/disable holidays & weekends\\\\n \\\\nIf you'd like to allow your users to select weekends / holidays when submitting the form or instead, limit them from doing so, you'll use the following guidance:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen editing the form, click on your Date question > Data section > Ensure the setting to \\\\\\\"Include holidays\\\\\\\"/ \\\\\\\"Include weekends\\\\\\\" is checked.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n\\\\na) If your form is creating an action card in a specific project, go to your project settings and ensure the option to \\\\\\\"Allow actions to be assigned on weekends\\\\\\\" is checked.\\\\n \\\\n Note: If your form is creating a project using a project template, you'll check this setting in your project template settings. \\\\n\\\\nb) If your form is creating an action without a project or an entirely new project, you'll go to your Workspace Settings > Project default settings > check the option to \\\\\\\"Allow actions to be assigned on weekends\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n# **Custom Logo for each form**\\\\n \\\\nTo upload a custom logo for each form, use the External Logo option in the General settings. This feature will enable each form to display a distinct logo, providing a personalized visual representation for each user interaction.\\\\n\\\\n# **Viewing & Downloading Form Submissions**\\\\n \\\\nYou can access the Form Submissions page by visiting the main Forms Library and clicking on the Form Stats.**​\\\\n\\\\nThis view allows you to see:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLink to the submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSubmission title\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDate of the submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSubmitted By\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSubmission Type (Action/Project)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nStatus (Action/Project status)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOther columns for all questions within the form and their recorded responses.\\\\n \\\\nFiltering and sorting options for columns are coming soon!\\\\n\\\\nUsers can also download the form submissions from the Submissions page.\\\\n \\\\n *Note - If the Form has a special character, the download will fail. Please do not include any special characters in the form title when exporting. \\\\n\\\\nThe export will include these columns in the CSV file:\\\\n \\\\n Submission**\\\\n \\\\n**Submitted At**\\\\n \\\\n**Submitted By**\\\\n \\\\n**Type**\\\\n \\\\n**Status**\\\\n \\\\nThis will be the title of the submission\\\\n \\\\nThis will show the date and time of when the form was submitted\\\\n \\\\nThis will show the name of the user who submitted the form\\\\n \\\\nThis will show what was created from the form submission\\\\n \\\\nThis will display the Status of the action card or project created from the submission.\\\\n \\\\n**+ Other columns for all questions within the form and their recorded responses.**\\\\n\\\\n# **Track submission progress**\\\\n \\\\nYou can also easily track the progress of your form submissions in real time! Forget the “Just checking in” emails — now the submission status & all details are visible instantly on the My Submissions page.\\\\n\\\\nTo enable this option for your users, go to the Form Editor and check the \\\\\\\"Allow submitters to track the form progress\\\\\\\" setting within the Submission Settings. \\\\n\\\\nUsers will be able to track progress after submission via this URL ( https://forms.hive.com/my-submissions ) or by clicking the 'View my Submissions' button right after the submission.\\\\n\\\\nSubmitters can do the following via this link:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nview all your submissions across all forms and workspaces\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nclick on the submission to briefly view more details, add a comment, and mention action followers.\\\\n\\\\nTo comment on the submission or @mention another user, you'll click on your submission on the 'My submissions' page and use the Comment section at the bottom.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Import tasks into Hive Hive for Slack Dynamic Fields in Hive Forms Run a modern agency on Hive Form Submissions Page  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 13903\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Dynamic Fields in Forms\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/2873120-dynamic-fields-in-hive-forms\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Dynamic Fields in Hive Forms | Hive Help \\\\n•     Using Hive Workflows with Forms & Automation Dynamic Fields in Hive Forms \\\\n# Dynamic Fields in Hive Forms\\\\n \\\\nFurther customize a form using dynamic fields\\\\n Written by Michaela Rollings Updated over 9 months ago  \\\\nJust getting started with forms? Review the article here to get you caught up. \\\\n\\\\nHive forms has become even more powerful with the introduction of dynamic fields.\\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Users\\\\n \\\\nDynamic users can automatically assign a member of your team to the action card that is created when a form is submitted. Once a form is submitted, that user is notified that they have been assigned a new action. When editing the field, be sure to click \\\\\\\"Map to action assignee\\\\\\\" to automatically assign the user to the card. \\\\n\\\\nOnly members of the project in which the form is being directed to will be available in the user dropdown list. For example, if I have a form being directed to a shared project only available to myself and another coworker, we are the only two users who will be available for selection in the dropdown. This is to protect project membership and assignment as you are only able to be assigned actions within projects that you are a member of. \\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Projects\\\\n \\\\nDynamic Project Question allows you to map the action card to a selected project or automatically link the action card to a project.\\\\n\\\\nIf the “Map to project” option is selected, the submission will create the action card in the selected project within the Dynamic Project Question.\\\\n\\\\nIf the “Map to linked projects” option is selected, the submission will create the action card in the project selected at the bottom of the form, but the action card will be linked to the chosen project.\\\\n\\\\n *Note - You must make sure the Form owner is part of the project you want to choose since the project you're searching for won't be in the dropdown if the Form owner is not part of the project. \\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Labels\\\\n \\\\nWith dynamic labels, the form submitter can select which label their form relates to. The action is then auto-labeled for the team that receives the request. When editing the field, select \\\\\\\"Map to label\\\\\\\". Then in the 'Available labels' drop-down, choose the labels that will be available for selection in this form.\\\\n\\\\nOnce complete, the user will be able to choose their assignee, project, and label(s) when submitting a form, and those fields will map directly back to Hive. \\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\nYou can also have dynamic custom fields in your form. You can choose between project and action custom fields. \\\\n\\\\nIf you go for action custom fields, don't forget to select 'Map it to action custom field' so that the response automatically fills in the custom field in the resulting action card.\\\\n\\\\n# Dynamic Priorities\\\\n \\\\nFinally, you may select the Dynamic Priorities question type, to display a drop-down list of the action card priorities in the workspace to the form submitter. You should map the answer to the priorities field, as shown here:\\\\n\\\\nOn the form, the question appears like this:\\\\n\\\\n# \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Import tasks into Hive Hive Forms Run a modern agency on Hive Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue Recipe Build: Form Submission - Update Action Based on Label  😞 😐 😃 Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3260\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"automation\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Hive Automate & Workflows\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Recipe-based workflow automation using triggers, actions, IF/ELSE conditions, Repeat Actions, datatree/datapills.

Business workflows across cloud and on-premise apps are established through the use of Actions and Triggers, into what we refer to as “Recipes”.\\\\n\\\\nRecipes are automated workflows that can span multiple apps. Each recipe comprises a trigger and one or more actions that can be carried out when the trigger event is picked up.\\\\n\\\\nActions can occur outright, or be triggered by IF conditions, IF/ELSE conditions, Repeat Actions, be made callable by other recipes, and provide error handling. Using these different variables, we can create multi-step workflows utilizing as many different applications as are necessary.\\\\n\\\\nFor example: A new user being invited to your HR program can invite a User to Hive. Then, this can kick off an action template in Hive for the new team member’s onboarding, and then send a message to a Slack group notifying the team of our new team member!\\\\n\\\\nAs we build out these workflows, we will most likely want to carry data from one step to the next. For example, we want the email address of our new team member to be what is used to create the account in Hive. Using the Datatree and Datapills available in Hive Automate, setting this up in your recipe is a simple drag-and-drop process. We cover this more in depth in the article “ How to Create A Recipe ”.\\\\n\\\\nReady to start building your own recipes?

Our Integrations team is releasing new recipes to the community weekly for you to plug-and-play or customize to fit your exact needs!\\\\n\\\\nWith Hive Automate you can not only create Hive-to-app and app-to-Hive integrations, but also automate aspects of your workflow directly within Hive itself.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, when an Action Card is marked complete in Hive, we’ll update the Due Date of the action card to the Completed Date, by using the date when it was modified to that status.\\\\n\\\\nThe example above, along with many others, is available in the Hive Automate Library for you to pull into your account, establish your connection, and start using right away! They can also be edited, if you want to take additional steps or further customizations in the recipe.\\\\n\\\\n## Access the Library\\\\n\\\\nNavigate to ‘Apps’ in the left-hand sidebar and scroll down to find Hive Automate.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf this isn’t already toggled on, toggle it on. Otherwise, click Open\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA secondary sidebar will appear. Select ‘Library’ in the sidebar.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nWe’re looking at a list of all of the available apps to connect! To see all the Hive Recipes, simply type Hive** and click on the Hive App. You can also type a recipe name or more detail to find specific recipes.\\\\n \\\\nFor example, you can type ‘Hive Forms’ to see all recipes related to Hive forms!\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nClick on any of the recipes that you’d like to use to see more details about the recipe and the specific steps involved.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nClick the ‘Use This Recipe’ button up in the top right corner to copy this into your account.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nYou’ll need to either put this recipe in a location folder or create a new folder, if none exist.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nAwesome! A few more steps and your recipe is up and running.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nEach recipe requires you to set a connection for the apps being used, so you’ll need to pass specific permissions before you can start the recipe in your workspace. You will see red boxes around any step that will not run until the connection is set. You can click on any of those red boxes to see the connection details\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nAll Hive connections require your API key, User ID, and Workspace ID. This article covers how to find your API keys in Hive. Enter your credentials and hit ‘Connect’. You will only need to do this once for each app that you use in your Hive Automate workspace. These recipes will honor the permissions you have in each app being used.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOnce you enter your permissions and see all red boxes disappear, you are ready! Hit the Save button in the top right, and then Exit the recipe editor.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on the Start Recipe button up in the top right, and your recipe is now running in your workspace.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you’d like to customize the recipe further, read on !\\\\n Related Articles What is Hive Automate?

When a recipe is started, it becomes **active**.\\\\n\\\\nStarting a recipe with a real-time trigger (like those in the Hive connector) will result in the recipe immediately listening for the specified events, with the specified trigger conditions. It will keep fetching events until the recipe is stopped.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a recipe with trigger time intervals is first started, it will fetch trigger events from the 'when first started, this recipe should pick up events from' configuration. Subsequently, it will continuously process these events. If you had defined the **Since/From** date during testing previously, this date cannot be changed again for this recipe\\\\n \\\\n## \\\\n\\\\n# **Stopping Recipes**\\\\n \\\\nStopping a recipe makes it **inactive**. It will stop picking up trigger events. Recipes have to be stopped to make changes to the recipe, or to rename the recipe.\\\\n\\\\nReal-time triggers powered by webhooks (like those in the Hive connector) will trigger events that occur during the time that the recipe is running. If the recipe was stopped triggers will not be picked up by the recipe during the time of inactivity.\\\\n\\\\nRecipes with trigger intervals will continue where they have left off when a recipe is restarted from a stopped state. For example, if it was stopped on Monday, and started again from Thursday, the recipe will fetch all trigger events since Monday and process them.\\\\n\\\\n ​\\\\n Related Articles What is Hive Automate?

Here are a few use cases we're excited about that are now possible with Hive Automate + Goals: \\\\n\\\\n## If your Goal is Driven by Revenue\\\\n \\\\nWe can connect to your CRM, like Salesforce or Hubspot, or your billing platform, to allow you to automatically update your Goal's current value for metrics like:\\\\n \\\\n$ Target for ARR in Q1\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n$ Target for Pipeline created\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n$ Target for Closed Won Business in a specific month or quarter\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n% of monthly churn in your customer base\\\\n\\\\n## If your Goal is Driven by Lead Volume\\\\n \\\\nSimilarly, we can connect to Hubspot or many other Marketing Automation tools to gather the current number of leads, or leads created over a given period. Measure Goals like: ​\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTotal Leads Created This Month\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLeads Converted This Quarter\\\\n\\\\n## If your Goal is Driven by Customer Sentiment\\\\n \\\\nMeasure and track your NPS, or other customer survey scores by connecting them directly into your Goals. If you're customer-centric, this is a must! Goals like:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOverall NPS this Year\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNPS in a Given Quarter\\\\n\\\\n💪 We're just getting started - let us know which tools power your Goals, and we'll work to add support for it. \\\\n\\\\n# Updating your Goal using Hive Automate\\\\n \\\\nUtilize the Hive Automate feature to automatically update your Goal in Hive. In this example, we will demonstrate how to add a numerical value to your current Goal using a custom field in an action card, triggered upon the completion of the action card.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, we will update our ARR goal by adding the value of the custom field to our overall Goal whenever an action card is completed in a specific project.\\\\n\\\\n1. Create a Goal that tracks numerical value.\\\\n\\\\n2. Create a Custom Field that captures the value of the account.\\\\n \\\\n 3. Create a Hive Automate recipe.\\\\n \\\\n4. Make a Hive Connection in Hive Automate. 5. Set up the recipe to capture when an action card is completed.\\\\n\\\\n6. Retrieve action card information by using the ID.\\\\n \\\\n ​\\\\n \\\\n7. Create a Variable in Hive Automate to capture the custom field value.\\\\n \\\\n a. [Custom Field datapill] is getting all of the custom field in that action card \\\\n \\\\n b. .where(\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"CUSTOM_FIELD_ID\\\\\\\") is grabbing the specific ID of the custom field \\\\n \\\\n If you need help getting the ID of your custom field, please reference our Get Custom Field ID documentation . \\\\n \\\\n c. .pluck('numberValue') is specifically grabbing the integer value of the custom field \\\\n \\\\n d. .join is converting the value from C and converting it from Array to String \\\\n \\\\n e. .to_i is converting the value from D and converting it from String to Integer \\\\n\\\\n8. Retrieve the details of a Goal. ​\\\\n\\\\n9. Create another Variable in Hive Automate that captures the Goal value.\\\\n\\\\n10. Use the Update Goal step to update the value of the Goal with the Action Card Custom Field.\\\\n\\\\nUpon completing an action card, the custom field value associated with the action card will be automatically added to the Goal value.\\\\n\\\\nPlease refer to the attached GIF for a visual demonstration. As you can observe, the Goal initially displayed a value of $46,000. However, upon completing the action card, the value increased to $56,000. This is because the action card’s custom field was set to a value of $10,000.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Link Jira to your Action Card or Project Datapills Recipe Build: Form Submission - Update Action Based on Label How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

You may encounter Lists, Hashes, or Lists of Hashes. Formulas in Hive Automate are whitelisted Ruby methods, and therefore not all Ruby methods are supported.\\\\n\\\\nYou can refer to the syntax and sample uses of these commands by clicking the links below: \\\\n \\\\n Lists (arrays) \\\\n \\\\n Hashes \\\\n \\\\n Lists of hashes \\\\n \\\\n Example list of hashes \\\\n \\\\n first \\\\n \\\\n last \\\\n \\\\n index \\\\n \\\\n where \\\\n \\\\n except \\\\n \\\\n pluck \\\\n \\\\n format_map \\\\n \\\\n join \\\\n \\\\n smart_join \\\\n \\\\n reverse \\\\n \\\\n sum \\\\n \\\\n uniq \\\\n \\\\n flatten \\\\n \\\\n length \\\\n \\\\n max \\\\n \\\\n min \\\\n \\\\n compact \\\\n \\\\n blank? \\\\n \\\\n include? \\\\n \\\\n present? \\\\n \\\\n presence \\\\n \\\\n to_csv \\\\n \\\\n to_json \\\\n \\\\n to_xml \\\\n \\\\n from_xml \\\\n \\\\n encode_www_form \\\\n \\\\n to_param \\\\n \\\\n keys \\\\n\\\\n# Lists (arrays)**\\\\n \\\\nArrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. List indexing starts at 0. Lists and arrays refer to the same data structure.\\\\n \\\\nIn the example below, a list of integers is expressed as:\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list = [100, 101, 102, 103, 104] As lists are ordered, we can use the following formula to get the values. Hive Automate only supports retrieving up to the fifth item using this syntax.\\\\n \\\\n**Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.first\\\\n \\\\n100\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.second\\\\n \\\\n101\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.third\\\\n \\\\n102\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.fourth\\\\n \\\\n103\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.fifth\\\\n \\\\n104\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list.last\\\\n \\\\n104\\\\n \\\\nWe can also use indexes to get corresponding values. Remember, indexes start at 0:\\\\n \\\\n**Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[0]\\\\n \\\\n100\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[1]\\\\n \\\\n101\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[2]\\\\n \\\\n102\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[3]\\\\n \\\\n103\\\\n \\\\nLists in Ruby supports negative indexes.\\\\n \\\\n**Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-1]\\\\n \\\\n104\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-2]\\\\n \\\\n103\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-3]\\\\n \\\\n102\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-4]\\\\n \\\\n101\\\\n \\\\nLists also support ranges as indexes. This returns another list, instead of returning only a value.\\\\n \\\\n**Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[0..2]\\\\n \\\\n[100, 101, 102]\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[-3..-1]\\\\n \\\\n[102, 103, 104]\\\\n \\\\nnumber_list[0..-2]\\\\n \\\\n[100, 101, 102, 103]\\\\n\\\\n# **Hashes**\\\\n \\\\nA hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar to Lists, but where a List uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.\\\\n \\\\nLet's take the example of a hash with 2 values, with 'Acme widgets' and 10 as the values of item_name and item_quantity respectively.\\\\n\\\\nline_item = { 'item_name' => 'Acme widgets', 'item_qty' => 10 } **Formula**\\\\n \\\\n**Result**\\\\n \\\\nline_item[\\\\\\\"item_name\\\\\\\"]\\\\n \\\\n\\\\\\\"Acme widgets\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\nline_item[\\\\\\\"item_qty\\\\\\\"]\\\\n \\\\n10\\\\n\\\\n# **Lists of hashes**\\\\n \\\\nHere is an example of an invoice which has multiple line items. It is represented as a list of hashes.\\\\n \\\\nline_items = [ { 'item_no': 1, 'item_name' => 'Acme widgets', 'item_qty' => 10 }, { 'item_no': 2, 'item_name' => 'RR bearings', 'item_qty' => 99 }, { 'item_no': 3, 'item_name' => 'Coyote tyres', 'item_qty' => 7 } ] \\\\n \\\\n# \\\\n \\\\n# **Example list of hashes**\\\\n \\\\nThe following is an example of a list of hashes called **Contacts**.\\\\n \\\\nThis is the Contacts list in a table form:\\\\n \\\\n**name**\\\\n \\\\n**email**\\\\n \\\\n**state**\\\\n \\\\n**company**\\\\n \\\\n**company_rev**\\\\n \\\\nJoe\\\\n \\\\n joe@abc.com \\\\n \\\\nCA\\\\n \\\\nABC\\\\n \\\\n1000\\\\n \\\\nJill\\\\n \\\\n jill@nbc.com \\\\n \\\\nMA\\\\n \\\\nNBC\\\\n \\\\n1000\\\\n \\\\nJoan\\\\n \\\\n joan@nbc.com \\\\n \\\\nMA\\\\n \\\\nNBC\\\\n \\\\n10000\\\\n \\\\nJack\\\\n \\\\n jack@hbo.com \\\\n \\\\nCA\\\\n \\\\nHBO\\\\n \\\\n30000\\\\n \\\\nThis is the Contacts list in a list of hashes form.\\\\n \\\\n[ **{ 'name' => 'Joe', 'email' => 'joe@abc.com', 'state' => 'CA', 'company' => 'ABC', 'company_rev' => 1000, 'description' => { 'summary' => 'First time buyer', 'estimated_value' => 300 } }, { 'name' => 'Jill', 'email' => 'jill@nbc.com', 'state' => 'MA', 'company' => 'NBC', 'company_rev' => 1000, 'description' => { 'summary' => 'Referral', 'estimated_value' => 500 } }, { 'name' => 'Joan', 'email' => 'joan@nbc.com', 'state' => 'MA', 'company' => 'NBC', 'company_rev' => 10000, 'description' => { 'summary' => 'Recurring customer', 'estimated_value' => 900 } }, { 'name' => 'Jack', 'email' => 'jack@hbo.com', 'state' => 'CA', 'company' => 'HBO', 'company_rev' => 30000, 'description' => { 'summary' => 'Recurring customer', 'estimated_value' => 1000 } } ] \\\\n\\\\n# first**\\\\n \\\\nThis formula returns the first item in a list.\\\\n \\\\nIt can also be used to return the first n items in a list.

However, using variables in a regex pattern requires escaping within the regex expression.\\\\n \\\\nFor example: contacts.where(state: /#{ datapill }/)\\\\n \\\\nThe image below shows the method used to obtain all the 'Emails' in lookup table where the value in the 'State' column contains the string in the datapill from Salesforce, State | Step 2 .\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** All regex metacharacters will need to be escaped if they should not be interpreted as metacharacters.\\\\n\\\\n**Example of chaining where conditions**\\\\n \\\\nIf a series of WHERE conditions are chained, the formula evaluates each where condition in series.\\\\n \\\\n contacts.where('state': 'CA').where('company_revenue >=': 10000) returns the following rows, which is the same as the compound where formula:\\\\n \\\\n**name**\\\\n \\\\n**email**\\\\n \\\\n**state**\\\\n \\\\n**company**\\\\n \\\\n**company_rev**\\\\n \\\\nJack\\\\n \\\\n jack@hbo.com \\\\n \\\\nCA\\\\n \\\\nHBO\\\\n \\\\n30000\\\\n \\\\nIn this case, however, the chaining will result in an intermediary array:\\\\n \\\\n contacts.where('state': 'CA') first returns:\\\\n \\\\n**name**\\\\n \\\\n**email**\\\\n \\\\n**state**\\\\n \\\\n**company**\\\\n \\\\n**company_rev**\\\\n \\\\nJoe\\\\n \\\\n joe@abc.om \\\\n \\\\nCA\\\\n \\\\nABC\\\\n \\\\n1000\\\\n \\\\nJack\\\\n \\\\n jack@hbo.com \\\\n \\\\nCA\\\\n \\\\nHBO\\\\n \\\\n30000\\\\n \\\\nAnd .where('company_revenue >=': 10000) filters this intermediary array further to return only:\\\\n \\\\n**name**\\\\n \\\\n**email**\\\\n \\\\n**state**\\\\n \\\\n**company**\\\\n \\\\n**company_rev**\\\\n \\\\nJack\\\\n \\\\n jack@hbo.com \\\\n \\\\nCA\\\\n \\\\nHBO\\\\n \\\\n30000\\\\n \\\\nResults will be expressed as a list of hashes:\\\\n \\\\n[ **{ 'name' => 'Jack', 'email' => 'jack@hbo.com', 'state' => 'CA', 'company' => 'HBO', 'company_rev' => '30000' } ] \\\\n\\\\n# except**\\\\n \\\\nReturns a hash that includes everything except given keys.\\\\n \\\\nhash = { a: true, b: false, c: nil } **hash.except(:c) # => { a: true, b: false } hash.except(:a, :b) # => { c: nil } hash # => { a: true, b: false, c: nil } \\\\n\\\\n# pluck**\\\\n \\\\n Retrieves only the columns which have been specified.\\\\n\\\\n## Sample usage\\\\n\\\\n**Example of a single column dataput**\\\\n \\\\n contacts.pluck(\\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\") returns\\\\n \\\\n**email**\\\\n \\\\n joe@abc.com \\\\n \\\\n jill@nbc.com \\\\n \\\\n joan@nbc.com \\\\n \\\\n jack@hbo.com \\\\n \\\\nIf a single column, results will be returned as an array:\\\\n \\\\n[\\\\\\\"joe@abc.com\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"jill@nbc.com\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"joan@nbc.com\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"jack@hbo.com\\\\\\\"] \\\\n \\\\n**Example of a multiple column dataset**\\\\n \\\\n contacts.where(\\\\\\\"state ==\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"CA\\\\\\\").pluck(\\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"company\\\\\\\") returns\\\\n \\\\n**email**\\\\n \\\\n**company**\\\\n \\\\n joe@abc.com \\\\n \\\\nABC\\\\n \\\\n jill@nbc.com \\\\n \\\\nNBC\\\\n \\\\n joan@nbc.com \\\\n \\\\nNBC\\\\n \\\\n jack@hbo.com \\\\n \\\\nHBO\\\\n \\\\nResults are returned as a list of a list:\\\\n \\\\n[[\\\\\\\"joe@abc.com\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"ABC\\\\\\\"], [\\\\\\\"jill@nbc.com\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"NBC\\\\\\\"], [\\\\\\\"joan@nbc.com\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"NBC\\\\\\\"], [\\\\\\\"jack@hbo.com\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"HBO\\\\\\\"]] \\\\n \\\\n**Example of retrieving nested fields**\\\\n \\\\nThis method can be used to extract nested fields.

This example routes the card to the correct project, and will assign the card to the correct person.\\\\n\\\\n## Create Recipe:\\\\n\\\\nIn Hive go to Apps:\\\\n\\\\nMake sure Hive Automate is enabled for your workspace. Then click Open. \\\\n \\\\n *Note: If you are turning this on for the first time and don’t have the Add-on yet, you will be given a two week trial of this feature and given 500 automation tasks to use during the trial. \\\\n\\\\nGo to My Recipes\\\\n\\\\nClick Create in the top right corner and select Recipe\\\\n\\\\nSet up your recipe by giving it a Name, and picking a location for the recipe to save in your Hive Automate folder structure. For this recipe the starting point we want is: Trigger from an app. Click Start Building.\\\\n\\\\n## Trigger:\\\\n\\\\nWhen a Hive Form is submitted it generally does one of two things. It either creates an action, or a project in Hive. The creation of that action or project is what we want our recipe to listen to. Click on the empty Trigger step:\\\\n\\\\n## **App:**\\\\n \\\\nA new panel will open on the right side of your screen asking you to choose an app. Search for Hive and select the Hive connector:\\\\n\\\\n## **Connection:**\\\\n \\\\nIt will then ask you to select your connection for the selected app. Choose the connection you want to use:\\\\n\\\\nIf you don’t have a Hive connection setup you can refer to the following article: Setting up your Hive connection \\\\n\\\\n## **Setup:**\\\\n \\\\nFor this guide we will focus on the trigger event New Action. If our form is set up to create a new action card then all of the information mapped from the form is added to the card on creation. That means we can use all of that information to create automations in Hive Automate.\\\\n\\\\nHere in the setup we have a decision to make. How do we want the recipe to know which new cards in our workspace should be affected by this recipe? There are many ways to do this but we recommend the following two options as they are the easiest to set up.\\\\n\\\\n**Option 1: New actions in specific project**\\\\n\\\\nIn the setup of the trigger you can simply pick the specific project you would like this recipe to listen to. This configuration above will tell the recipe that it should listen for all new action cards created in the project selected in that drop down menu.\\\\n\\\\n**Option 2: New actions in any project**\\\\n\\\\nThe second option would be to set up a trigger condition based on some attribute of the new action card instead of a specific project. In the configuration of your form there is the ability to map the Form Name to the title of the submitted card. If you have selected that option you can have the trigger listen for if the title of the new action contains a specific string. You would configure the Value above to match the name of your Hive Form.\\\\n\\\\nYou could of course do a combination of both options listed above, so that you only listen for actions in a specific project, that also have a specific form name in the title. You can add conditions as well if you would like to narrow the trigger down further for more advanced requirements.\\\\n\\\\nLast step here is we want to add the following conditional:\\\\n\\\\nThis conditional just ensures that we are only listening to parent action cards. If you are applying a template in the form that includes subactions it would cause the recipe to run when it saw all those new subactions created as well. \\\\n\\\\n## Actions:\\\\n \\\\nNow that the trigger is configured to listen for a specific event, we need to tell the recipe what actions in the workflow we want to happen. Click the + button under the word Actions and let's take a look at our options for creating actions:\\\\n\\\\nHere we have a few options of what we can do with our workflow. The first four listed are the most commonly used:\\\\n \\\\nAction in an app: Take a step to do something in one of the connectors.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIF condition: Add a section to the recipe that only will occur if the condition is satisfied.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIF/ELSE condition: Add two sections to the recipe where only the top section will occur if the condition is satisfied, and only the bottom if the condition is not satisfied.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRepeat action: Add a section to the recipe that will loop through a list of items.\\\\n\\\\n## **IF Condition:**\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow we are trying to implement does require that we take another Action in an app, but we don’t know what action to take yet. Let's start with the IF condition, to make sure we change the right thing, on the right Hive action card. Click IF condition.\\\\n\\\\nYour recipe will now have 2 new action steps. The parent step is for setting up the conditional, and the child step is blank for you to choose what to do inside the IF conditional. We can check for all kinds of attributes that the new action card has. Some ideas would be: Title, description, due-date, assignee, created by, custom fields, or labels. \\\\n\\\\nFor this guide we are going to look at labels. Label data on an action card is given as a list of Label IDs. We can use this list to check if it contains a specific Label ID. Essentially saying if the new action card has a specific label on it, then the IF condition is true:\\\\n\\\\n## **Hive - Update Action:**\\\\n\\\\nThis step in the recipe is nested inside the IF condition from above so that it will only run if the condition was true. We are going to go ahead and click action step 3 and select Hive as our connector again. Then select Update record:\\\\n\\\\nOnce the action is selected you will be brought to the setup tab. The two mandatory fields here are the type of Object, and then the ID for that object. For this workflow we want to update the Hive action card that triggered the recipe, so we pick Action as our object, and then pass the data pill ID from step 1 into the Action ID we want to edit:\\\\n\\\\nNow the recipe knows what record to update inside the IF condition. From here you can select any changes to that Hive action card that you would like. This is essentially where you are creating the mapping in the recipe. For the specific label, what changes are you looking to automatically apply? The most common fields to change would be the Assignee or the Project you want this action card to go to. Simply pick the values from the following drop downs that you would like. If you want to see a full list of fields available to edit you can click on the optional fields button at the bottom:\\\\n\\\\nCongratulations! You now have one mapping completely set up. How do we go about configuring other mappings? Hive Automate has a copy and paste feature that can make the subsequent mappings go much faster:\\\\n\\\\nSimply hover your mouse to the right of the Action step you wish to copy. Click the three horizontal dots, and click Copy. If you copy a conditional bucket it will automatically copy everything inside it as well.\\\\n\\\\nOnce copied you can then paste the selection. Hover your mouse around the area of your recipe where you want to paste the copied step(s):\\\\n\\\\nClick the paste button shown above and a copy of the IF section will appear. From here all you need to do is change the Label ID inside the condition step, and change the update action in Hive step to map the correct Assignee, Project, or any other fields you might have set up. You can continue the copy/paste process until all of the logic you want is complete.\\\\n\\\\nWe always recommend testing your recipes before starting them by hitting the Test button in the top right corner. This will turn the recipe on for one submission to test functionality. Simply hit the test button and submit a form to make sure it functions as you intended.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you are finished remember to Save your recipe and hit Exit. Back on the main recipe page you can now Start your recipe and Hive Automate will handle all future submissions that meet the trigger criteria.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Everything about Labels Creating your First Recipe Testing Recipes Starting & Stopping Recipes Slack/Teams: Messages  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 8622\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"proofing\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Proofing & Approvals\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"File review with annotations, approval routing (internal + external), templates, video proofing, concurrent reviews, approval reporting, and proofing tool with measurement/markup capabilities.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 4,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 29876,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Proofing & Approvals\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/2931726-simple-integrated-proofing-approvals\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Simple, integrated Proofing & Approvals | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Proofing & Approvals Simple, integrated Proofing & Approvals \\\\n# Simple, integrated Proofing & Approvals\\\\n \\\\nFaster turnaround, fewer approval rounds and easier tracking of who approved and when using Hive Proofing and Approvals\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 4 months ago  \\\\n Start by turning on Proofing & Approvals in the Apps page. **\\\\n\\\\nGo to the Apps page in Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnsure that the **Proofing& Approvals** app is turned on.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf the approval section still doesn’t show up in the action card:\\\\n \\\\nCheck the project's settings to ensure the proofing app is enabled in the \\\\\\\"**Apps that appear in action cards**\\\\\\\" dropdown.\\\\n\\\\n Note!

Proof URL links**\\\\n \\\\nUsers can click the Add proof button and click the '**Link**' option to upload a URL as proof. This will allow you to enter the desired URL and specify if you'd like it to be displayed as a Live Website, Page Snapshot or a Hyperlink. \\\\n\\\\n## **13. **Combine multiple files into one document for proofing\\\\n \\\\nWhen a user uploads multiple files at once, users have three choices:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nUpload as a combined file\\\\n \\\\nChoosing this option will combine those files into 1 long file and convert them to a single PDF file\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nUpload individual files as subactions\\\\n \\\\nEach file will create its own subaction and they will inherit the title of the files. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nUpload as folder\\\\n \\\\nAllows to request approval on all uploaded files as a single folder.\\\\n \\\\nSelecting this option will open a table of all assets with the Approval status next to each. As a reviewer, you can stamp each individual file or all of them as a folder.\\\\n \\\\n**Note**: When rejecting one of the files, you must still approve or request changes on the entire folder.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nYou can delete the folder by going to the three-dots menu at the top of your folder:\\\\n\\\\n## **14. Lock a proof**\\\\n \\\\nOnce all comments and feedback have been added, you can lock your proof. All admins as well as the user who uploaded the proof are able to lock it. To do it, you need to click \\\\\\\"Lock proof\\\\\\\" on the bottom right-hand corner of the image.\\\\n\\\\n## **15. Lock a round**\\\\n \\\\nThe Admins and the Project Owner can decide to lock the Round once it gets completed.\\\\n \\\\nTo do it, you'll need to enable \\\\\\\" Lock proofing rounds once complete \\\\\\\" under Approval rounds.\\\\n\\\\n## **16. Reset a round**\\\\n \\\\nIf a mistake is made in a round flow, you can easily reset a round. It will clear the previous approvals and start the round again.\\\\n\\\\n# Supported file types\\\\n \\\\nThe following file types are supported in proofing:**​ Documents .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xslx, .pptx, .rtf, .odt, .ods, .odp\\\\n\\\\n Images .bmp, .wmf, .emf, .hdp, .jpg, .jp2, .jpc, .png, .tif, .tiff\\\\n\\\\n Videos .mp4, .ogg, .webm\\\\n\\\\n Other \\\\n \\\\n.xps, .oxps, .xml, .xod, .\\\\n\\\\n# Troubleshooting Common Approval Issues\\\\n \\\\n## Why Do the Approval Buttons Disappear for a File?\\\\n \\\\nApproval buttons may disappear after a file has been approved. This behavior occurs because the proof is already approved, disabling the buttons as no further approval actions are required.\\\\n\\\\n## Why Are Approvals Not Visible in the 'My Approvals' Tab?\\\\n \\\\nThe 'My Approvals' tab may not display requests due to filtering settings. For example, if the action card with an approval request has been marked as completed, it may be filtered out:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOpen the Filters section of the 'My Approvals' tab.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnable the Completed** filter to include completed approvals in the view.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Proofing and approvals with external approvers Approvals Reporting Proofing and Proofing Tool FAQs Approval Routing FAQ Hive for Adobe Creative Cloud  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 12211\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Approval Templates\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4532667-approval-templates\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Approval Templates | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Proofing & Approvals Approval Templates \\\\n# Approval Templates\\\\n \\\\nHive can templatize specific approval workflows that dictate how work should be approved every time to save time & ensure standardization.\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over a year ago  \\\\n## Saving a workflow as a template\\\\n \\\\nTo begin, you'll need to add at least one stage and an approver to the workflow.

You can either upload multiple documents as one proof, or upload the documents as individual files.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you review the proof at the same time as someone else? Can you see who else has the file open?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, concurrent reviews of the file are supported for collaborative reviews. Their comments will appear live during your review. \\\\n\\\\n## **How do you replace a proof?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you mistakenly uploaded a proof, you can upload the correct file and it will become the latest file on top and ready for review/routing or you can use the trash can icon to delete the proof.\\\\n\\\\n## **When overriding a round in progress, is the previous proof version kept?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes. When uploading a new proof while the round is in progress, the previous version is pushed back to the **show previous file versions** section, and the new file uploaded is now the current version. \\\\n\\\\n## **Where can I see who’s uploaded the PDF?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHovering over the name of the proof on the action card, provides the name of the person that uploaded the proof as well as the timestamp for when it was uploaded.\\\\n \\\\n## **Is it possible to lock a proof?**\\\\n \\\\nYes, all admins as well as the user who uploaded the proof are able to lock it. To do it, you need to click \\\\\\\"Lock proof\\\\\\\" on the bottom right-hand corner of the image.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is it possible to lock a Round?**\\\\n \\\\nYes, the Admins and the Project Owner can decide to lock the Round once it gets completed.\\\\n \\\\nTo do it, you'll need to enable \\\\\\\" Lock proofing rounds once complete \\\\\\\" under Approval rounds.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the Round is locked, the user will not be able to:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDelete round\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nApply template\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChange \\\\\\\"Move to next stage when\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# ** Navigating in Hive’s Proofing Tool **\\\\n \\\\n## **Can you change the location of the Comments Panel?

Use the paperclip icon under the 'Insert' tab on the top bar.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Pro Tip:** Once you click the paperclip icon, then click on the proof to designate the location on the proof where you want the file to be located. \\\\n\\\\n## **If you close out of the files, does it automatically save your markups?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen adding a comment on the file (eg., shape), it is automatically saved. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you add or edit the text in the comment from the Comments Panel, you need to click on **Save** for this comment. This also applies to replies to comments made from the Comments Panel.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can I search for text on image files?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou are able to search for text within the file from the search bar at the top right corner. Image search is dependent on the image type (live text vs. flattened file).\\\\n\\\\n## **Can I compare proof versions side-by-side?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick in the '+' icon on the upper right-hand side of the proofing tool, Then you'll be able to select which file from those uploaded to the action card you'd like to compare. You can compare up to 3 files side by side\\\\n\\\\n## **When you compare documents can you view them on 2 separate screens?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCurrently, when comparing proof versions they aren’t able to open in separate screens. However, Hive can be opened in different tabs of the web browser and then moved to the 2 different screens.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can the old version appear on the left side, and the new one on the right side?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, this is possible when comparing proof versions by selecting in the file dropdown on the left side the old version, opening the File Compare tool and selecting the new version for the proof viewed on the right side.\\\\n\\\\n**What does the 'Show Callouts' button mean?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis button allows the callout comment style (i.e., the box and arrow style annotation) to be displayed on the proof and comments panel or not. All callouts in the proof will not appear on the proof or in the comments panel when unchecked.\\\\n\\\\n**​\\\\n \\\\n## Can you use keyboard shortcuts in the Proofing Tool?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAbsolutely! There are a lot of shortcuts you can use to manage comments and open comment tools\\\\n\\\\n# ** Commenting and Reviewing in the Hive Proofing Tool **\\\\n \\\\n**How do I add comments, annotations, markups to a document in the Hive Proofing Tool?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUse the Annotation, Shapes, Insert, and Measure tabs to view the available comment types. Select which one you'd like to you and then where on the proof you want to apply the annotation.\\\\n \\\\n## **What is the easiest way to delete a comment?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe easiest way to delete a comment is to select the comment and click on the trash can icon under it on the proof. This action deletes the comments from the proof and the Comments Panel. Or on select the comment in the comments panel and click on the three dots icon to open the dropdown to see the delete comment option.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo bulk delete comments in a certain file area, you can also use the Eraser Tool.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you move/delete multiple comments at the same time?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can select multiple comments at the same time maintaining the CONTROL key and clicking on the relevant comments, and: (1) Press the DELETE key to delete all the selected comments, (2) Drag them to move their location at the same time\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you edit your markups after you’ve saved them but, before you’ve completed your review?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you may edit and delete your own markups. Remember to select **Save** after making edits.\\\\n\\\\n## **Are previous reviewers’ comments locked so they cannot be accidentally deleted?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNo, Hive is a very collaborative tool allowing prior comments and markups can be deleted or edited by other team members. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA best practice would be to instruct users not to delete comments, but add a reply or apply a status such as “Canceled” if the comment no longer applies.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you group multiple comments? Can you apply one comment to all the selections?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can select multiple comments at the same time maintaining the CONTROL key and clicking on the relevant comments. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen doing so the Group option (button with the circle with 3 dots) will appear to group the selected comments. If comments are grouped, these will appear under one single comment in the Comments Panel, with the copy of the one selected first.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you change (and save) the thickness/opacity of the freehand and shape tools?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can change these. There is a drop-down menu on the markup tools, and your last selection in terms of color, thickness, opacity is remembered the next time you open the proofing tool. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOr after a comment has already been applied, highlight it on the proof and select the painter's palette icon (style guide) that allows you to update the color, border, and fill of select annotations.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you set a default color for text highlights? When a color is set, is it for all the tools?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen selecting a color for one of the comment tools, this setting will be saved for you in the Proofing Tool across all the proofs. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou can set one color for each type of comment tool. \\\\n\\\\n## **Does Hive have an insert text tool? What about strikethrough and replace? **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nInsert text and strikethrough tools are available. The replace tool is not yet available in Hive’s proofing tool, but the strikethrough tool may be used for this purpose by adding the new copy in the comment.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you draw a straight line in Hive?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, once you select the line tool, it is applied by pressing down and dragging to create the line.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can we create custom stamps?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Hive proofing tool includes a library of existing stamps under the ‘Insert’ tab where there is also the option to add a ‘custom’ stamp displaying the user’s name, time stamp, and/or custom text.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is it possible to turn on a ruler and drag a guide over to measure?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Measurement Tools are available under the Measure tab and can be used to measure and serve as a ruler. For alignment purposes, you can use the Line Tool.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you sort comments by name?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can use the Sort by' option on the right side of the comments panel to sort the comments by Author.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn addition to Author, you can also sort the comments by Position (i.e., position on the proof pages), Time, Status, or Type.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn the MP4 proof, you can also sort by Created Date, Modified Date, Status, Author, Type, Color, Frame, and Timecode.\\\\n\\\\n## **If reviewing comments, can we apply statuses for each? **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, click on the comment in the comments panel. The statuses can be applied, for the status icon to the right-hand side of the commenter’s name.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nComments can then be sorted by status in the ‘Sort By’ option or filtered on status using the ‘Search Comments’ box.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is there an undo function, for example, if I delete a comment by mistake?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you can undo any action (eg., add/delete comment) by pressing CONTROL + Z or using the back arrow to the right of the annotations icons. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou can undo as many as you need as long as you don’t close out the proof.\\\\n\\\\n## **Do I need to download and re-upload a proof when reviewing a file?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNo, you can perform your review directly in Hive’s proofing tool by clicking on the file visual on the action card to open the file in the proofing tool. The proofing tool is online, so you can add your comments directly in the file.\\\\n\\\\n## **Is there an option to auto-compare?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe auto-compare option is currently not available in Hive’s Proofing tool.\\\\n\\\\n## **Can you import comments from one version to another?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYes, you may transfer all callouts (the box and arrow style annotation), select comments, or all comments to a new version of the proof.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo do so, Open the file you would like to copy them into first, then use the '+' button on the upper right side to add the file with the comments so the proof versions are side-by-side. Next, click the arrow button for transfer comments.\\\\n\\\\n## **If I need to add or remove a page of my proof but still need to transfer over comments, how could I do this?**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFirst transfer over the comments from the older version to the file that will be the new version before a page is added or removed.

To do so, click the **+ Add time **button and search for the appropriate project. \\\\n\\\\nNext, add in the hours for each day you worked on that project. You will see the weekly total hours for that project under **Total **column.\\\\n\\\\n The number on the left is hours you have logged and the number on the right is hours you were Resourced for or Estimated for. \\\\n \\\\n **If your organization uses Time Categories** to segment and classify your hours worked, you will add each category and log time in the row of the category. If there is no category for time, you will just input any time logged for the project on the \\\\\\\"No category\\\\\\\" row.  Use the '+' icon next to the project name to select the category\\\\n\\\\nYou can also see the total hours logged for each day at the bottom of the columns for the days. \\\\n\\\\n## Submitting Timesheet by Action Card's Time Tracking\\\\n \\\\n This method is used when you DO track time in an action card but DO NOT use assignments in the Resourcing app. \\\\n\\\\n### Tracking Time in Action Card for Timesheet\\\\n \\\\nIf you do not want to track the times manually in the Timesheet, you can log the time in the action card, and that time will automatically appear in the Timesheet for that week.\\\\n\\\\nTo make an action card appear in the Timesheet, the workspace admin must set \\\\\\\"**Automatically fill from:\\\\\\\" **to \\\\\\\"**Time recorded from action cards**.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThen the user can open or create an action card, enter the time, choose the date, choose the person, add a category (optional), add a description (optional), and then click Add time.\\\\n\\\\nNow, any time that gets tracked in the action card will appear in the Timesheet automatically!\\\\n\\\\n## Tracking Time in Timesheet into Action Card\\\\n \\\\nIf a user wants to add an existing action card to the Timesheet, the user can click on the **(+) Add action**, search for the action card, then click \\\\\\\"Add action\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nFrom here, the user can manually enter the time they worked on the Timesheet, and the entered values will automatically get populated to the Time Tracking app in the action card!\\\\n\\\\n## Submitting Timesheet by Resource Assignment\\\\n \\\\n This method is used when you DO NOT track time in an action card but DO use assignments in the Resourcing app. \\\\n\\\\nIf you want the Resourcing App's assignment to automatically get populated in the Timesheet, the Workspace Admin must set \\\\\\\"**Automatically fill from:\\\\\\\" **to \\\\\\\"**Assigned hours in Resource Assignments**.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow, the user can go to the Resourcing App, create a Resource Assignment for a user, choose a project, enter appropriate hours, and confirm the hours, then the Assignment will show up in the user's Timesheet!\\\\n\\\\n**Tip**: To save some time, you can select the \\\\\\\"Fill resource assignment hours\\\\\\\" option to pre-fill cells with your Resourced hours. Please note, this will clear out any previous unsubmitted entries in those cells and will replace the values with the pre-fill values.\\\\n\\\\n# Submit your timesheet\\\\n \\\\nOnce you have filled in your timesheet for the week, you will submit the timesheet for approval using the **Submit **button.

This allows you to get a bird's eye view of individuals' time and project spending.\\\\n\\\\nNote: If a timesheet is pending approval or is rejected, the hours will not be incorporated into Timesheet Reporting.\\\\n\\\\n## To open the timesheet reporting\\\\n \\\\nGo to the Timesheets app ('Time'). Workspace admins can enable Timesheets in Hive Apps if not already enabled.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on the clipboard icon on the upper right-hand side and select the \\\\\\\"Reporting\\\\\\\" option:\\\\n\\\\n## Configuring reports\\\\n \\\\nWithin Timesheet Reporting, you can adjust how the data is grouped (by week, month, year) and filter date ranges to pull in data within a specific time period. To select what data is viewable, you can select various \\\\\\\"Display\\\\\\\" options. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also export the data for further analysis.\\\\n\\\\nBy default, the data is rolled up by project for easier billing to clients. To roll-up time by individuals, for easier team management, click the \\\\\\\"switch\\\\\\\" button.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, you can filter the data using the 'Filters' option to filter by project, project tags, custom fields, users, teams, roles, labels, timesheet categories, and Timesheet status. ​\\\\n \\\\n# Reporting Data\\\\n \\\\n## Hours\\\\n \\\\n Calculation: Sum of hours submitted for a project/person This is the total amount of time submitted for a project or person. \\\\n\\\\nExample: A user submits 40 hours of work every week for 4 weeks of a month to Project A. Their \\\\\\\"Hours\\\\\\\" for the month will appear as 160. ​\\\\n\\\\n## Billable\\\\n \\\\n Calculation: # of hours submitted x bill rate This is the dollar equivalent of the time submitted. It is often used as the amount at which a client is billed for the hours spent on their project.\\\\n\\\\nExample: A user's bill rate is $100/hour. They submit 10 hours of work to Project A for the week. Their \\\\\\\"Billable\\\\\\\" amount for the week will appear as $1000. ​\\\\n\\\\n## Utilization\\\\n \\\\n Calculation: # of hours submitted / capacity This is the percent of available/billable work hours that have time submitted. A person's capacity is determined in Resourcing. By default, Resourcing sets everyone's availability to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. ​ Example: A user's work week capacity is 40 hours. They submit 30 hours for the week. Their \\\\\\\"Utilization\\\\\\\" will appear as 75%.\\\\n\\\\nIf a user's availability needs a custom hours, this can be accessed by going to Resourcing > User Profile.\\\\n\\\\nIf the user’s workweek hours are not provided, Hive will utilize the Threshold value specified in the Resourcing settings. In the absence of a Threshold value, Hive will default to the Working day value.\\\\n\\\\n## Utilization Targets\\\\n \\\\nThis is the utilization percentage that is set in each user's profile in Resourcing, as shown here:\\\\n\\\\n## Comments**\\\\n \\\\nTo see and export the comments users left on their timesheet submissions, export the Timesheet reporting with the following settings:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nShow time by week\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDetailed level of export\\\\n\\\\n# Reporting Visibility\\\\n \\\\nBy default, timesheets are routed to Project Owners. This means Project Owners, in addition to Managers and Workspace Admins, can view the time data in Reporting.\\\\n\\\\nUsers can edit the project to route to Managers instead. This means only Managers and Workspace Admins can view the time data in reporting. (To set or adjust managers, edit the user's profile in Resourcing.)\\\\n\\\\nPlease note! Admins can also restrict access to Timesheets reporting to select users only - if you can't find the reporting, it means you don't have access to it. \\\\n Related Articles Submitting your Timesheet Timesheets for Timesheet Approvers Timesheets for Admins Budgets in Hive Track how your team spends time  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3968\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"resourcing\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Resourcing 2.0\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Premium add-on for team capacity planning.

Clicking the pin icon will create a shortcut to the app in your land-hand navigation panel. \\\\n\\\\nNote that access to Resourcing can be restricted under settings. This will be discussed further below under the Settings section. \\\\n\\\\n# Navigating Resourcing\\\\n\\\\nWhen navigating to the Resourcing Application, buttons along the top row allow you to:\\\\n \\\\n- create a new resource Allocation / Assignment / Time Off / Placeholder\\\\n \\\\n- toggle between the User, Teams & Projects views\\\\n \\\\n- change the timeframe displayed\\\\n \\\\n- access the Capacity finder\\\\n \\\\n- apply filters\\\\n \\\\n- access the Resourcing settings page under the 'More' menu. \\\\n \\\\n**Create Button**\\\\n \\\\nClicking **Create **will allow you to create a Project-level Allocation, Action-level Assignment, Time-Off entry for a user, or a Placeholder . Clicking any of these options will open the creation window. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou must select the relevant project, resource, date, and time for your entry. Assignment notes and Leave Types are optional but helpful for context. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Day, Week, Month Toggle**\\\\n \\\\nThe toggle to the right of the creation button allows you to switch views between seeing Users by Project or Project by Users which are discussed below. The **'D, W, M' **toggle allows you to increase or decrease the granularity of your view between Day, Week, and Month. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClicking any of these options will change the date range picker to the right and allow you to customize your view. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Filters**\\\\n \\\\n**Filters **are key to using Resourcing and can be found on the right-hand side of the top navigation panel by clicking on the '**Configure**' button.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFrom here, you can switch between density, toggle between hours and percentages, toggle between estimates and allocations, apply preset saved filters, and access many other filters.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUse the 'Add Filter' button to allow additional options for filtering or hide undeeded filters from the view using the X button.\\\\n\\\\nLet's talk more about these:\\\\n \\\\n**Density - **This option allows you to switch between Compact & Extended density of your Resourcing view.\\\\n \\\\n a) Extended - each project & its data are listed underneath each user.\\\\n \\\\n b) Compact - the view does not include project or user-level sections and instead combines all Estimates to one section and all Allocations to another.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Display as Toggle (Hours and %) - **This toggle changes how data is presented in the Resourcing grid. In previous versions of Resourcing, this was workspace-wide but now this is **user-based. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Utilization Toggle (Estimate vs Allocation) - **This toggle dictates how the calculation in the resourcing grid is being performed. \\\\n \\\\n a) When set to 'Estimate', this is looking at estimated time over a user's total capacity. Each project row shows estimated time for that project over a user's capacity. If the user's time is divided across multiple projects, you can now easily see how this breaks down. \\\\n \\\\n b) When set to 'Allocation', this is looking at the user's allocated hours over their available capacity. It also shows a breakdown at the project level for easy comparison. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also use the '**Compare Est vs Alloc'** Toggle to see the relationship between allocated and estimated hours. With this toggle enabled you will see different data types in the grid that may not have been present before.\\\\n \\\\n0% indicates that a project has an allocation but no estimate present. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHours without coloration indicate that there is an estimate but no allocation present. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis allows you to see everywhere where data is present on the grid while also being able to see the relationship between data. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Presets** - Want to save your filters for the team? Click the 'Select Preset' button which will pop up a \\\\\\\"+Create a preset\\\\\\\" option and save your filters for easy access in the future. \\\\n\\\\nPlease remember that: \\\\n \\\\nYou cannot adjust the previous toggles when in compare mode. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThese toggles and Compare checkbox are **user specific** so it will not impact another resource manager looking at the same data.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Capacity Finder**\\\\n \\\\n**Capacity Finder **is a more advanced filter that allows you to quickly sort through your data. Do you have a last-minute request and need to find out who is available? Use Capacity Finder. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**More Menu**\\\\n \\\\nAccess the Resourcing Settings page and the Resourcing Reporting page.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Resourcing Settings page contains the location for defining how data is shown as well as where placeholders, user tags, project tags, and roles can be created. See below for more details on the Resourcing Settings page. \\\\n\\\\nThe Resourcing app chart shows the designated allocated time and the assigned time that a user is expected to be booked on a project or action. More to come on the differences between allocated and assigned time later in this guide. \\\\n\\\\nWhen allocations are made at the project level and assignments are made at the action or project level they will be reflected on the Resourcing chart as horizontal lines detailing the span of the assignment and the total number of time (hours or percentage of total capacity). The color coding helps to distinguish between allocated time and estimated time as well as identify when someone is over capacity:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Purple**: Allocated time\\\\n \\\\nDark Purple: Hard Allocations\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLight Purple: Soft Allocations\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Blue**: Assigned Estimated Time\\\\n \\\\nDark Blue: Confirmed Assignments\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLight Blue: Unconfirmed Assignments\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Pink**: User is overstaffed; assigned time is over their threshold (i.e., over 8 hours per day) \\\\n\\\\n# Views in Resourcing\\\\n \\\\nThere are three data views available within Resourcing that can be toggled using the button to the right of **Create. **This toggle allows you to choose whether Users, Teams or Projects are at the top of your hierarchy for sorting. \\\\n\\\\n### **Users View**\\\\n \\\\nWhen 'Users' is selected, Users will be the top level with each project they are working on as the second level of the hierarchy. Actions and Resource Assignments will be organized by project, with Time Off in its own row. \\\\n\\\\nThe purple numbers in this view represent the project’s consumed allocation in a percentage. When that percentage is exceeded for a given time frame, we see the change to dark purple and the percentage exceeding 100%.\\\\n\\\\nSo let’s say, for example, we sold “Product Roadmap” for 40 hours of design work over the course of a week. We can set that allocation for the project, and then begin building out our project plan in action cards or resource assignments. As we estimate action cards and assignments, they are compared against the allocation and are shown as a percentage. As a Resource Manager, I know that I can keep my projects within budget and within a timeline as long as I don’t exceed my set allocations. \\\\n\\\\n### **Projects View **\\\\n \\\\nWhen 'Projects' is selected, Projects will be at the top level with each user within the project making up the second level of the hierarchy. \\\\n\\\\nIn this view, the percentage of consumed allocation totaled for the project is shown in purple. This allows you to answer the question \\\\\\\"Across the whole project, are we staying within our available hours?\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis view will also let you answer \\\\\\\"Am I maintaining the total number of hours available to spend by role or resource?\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n### **Teams View **\\\\n \\\\nWhen 'Teams' is selected, Teams will be at the top level with each user within the team making up the second level of the hierarchy. Expanding each user dropdown will allow you to see the list of projects & actions assigned to them.\\\\n\\\\nThe purple numbers in this view represent the team's consumed allocation/estimates.\\\\n\\\\nNote: If the user is part of multiple teams, their name will be displayed under each team accordingly.\\\\n\\\\n# Getting Started\\\\n \\\\n**Adding An Allocation (Project-Level Only) **\\\\n\\\\nTo add an Allocation, you can click 'Create' or drag-and-drop within the allocation field for the selected project and user. \\\\n\\\\n**Adding a Resource Assignment**\\\\n\\\\nTo populate estimated time in Resourcing, you will need the following items: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimated Time\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssigned User(s)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDate or Date Range. \\\\n\\\\nYou can create individual action-level estimates by turning on **Time Tracking **in Apps and adding estimates to your Action Cards as seen below. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also create more general estimates on a project level. Simply click 'Create', or drag-and-drop within Estimated for the relevant date range. You can also double-click on a date to open the 'Create Assignment' window. \\\\n\\\\n# **Allocation vs Estimate **\\\\n \\\\nWhen discussing Resourcing, it is important to distinguish between what is an allocation and what is an estimate for your user or project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Allocation** refers to the number of hours available for a user for a project. Allocation refers to how much a resource is \\\\\\\"planned\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"allowed\\\\\\\" to work on a project, based on who is available and/or most capable of performing the work. \\\\n \\\\nThe allocation capability is commonly used for planning purposes where a user's total availability is allocated across projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you think **allocation, think about what was sold or committed to. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAllocations can be made to specific users at the project level. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThese are \\\\\\\"Purple\\\\\\\" in Resourcing. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThere are two main types of allocation - hard and soft - which are denoted by a checkbox when creating the allocation. \\\\n \\\\n**Hard Allocation**: The team member has been \\\\\\\"confirmed\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"booked\\\\\\\" to work on the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Soft Allocation: **The team member or unnamed resource is tentatively 'penciled in' to work on the project.\\\\n\\\\n**The \\\\\\\"Estimated\\\\\\\" Row in the Resourcing grid is the collection of action cards and Resource Assignments**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Assignments** refer to the booked and estimated time a user has been assigned to work within a project. \\\\n \\\\nAssignments can be made at both the project and action level. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssignments in Resourcing are powered by the estimated time that a user is assigned to work on a project or a tasks within the project\\\\n\\\\n# \\\\n\\\\n# Resourcing Reporting & Exports\\\\n\\\\nResource Reporting can be found under the 'More' menu in the top right corner by clicking 'Reporting'. \\\\n\\\\nThere are three key reports contained within Reporting:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTotal Hours Performance\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject Breakdown \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nStaffing Breakdown\\\\n\\\\n**Filters**\\\\n\\\\nResourcing Reporting comes with in-app filtering available by clicking 'Filters' in the top right corner. \\\\n\\\\nThis will allow you to flex the data based on the time period, projects, roles, and assignees. Project Status refers to the status set on the overview page of each project. \\\\n\\\\n# Resourcing Terminology\\\\n\\\\n### Utilization\\\\n \\\\nUtilization is the measure of how much of your available resources you are currently using. This can be best seen as a formula: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUtilization = All hours logged (excluding [PTO] projects) / Total capacity (workweek)\\\\n \\\\n### Capacity\\\\n \\\\nCapacity is the maximum level of output that someone is capable of delivering \\\\n\\\\n Example: 8 hours/day of availability = 8 hours of capacity for a given day \\\\n\\\\n### Allocation\\\\n \\\\nAllocations are **project-specific units of measure. **They refer to how much a resource is \\\\\\\"planned\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"allowed\\\\\\\" to work on a project, based on who is available and/or most capable of performing the work. There are two main types of allocation - hard and soft - which are denoted by a checkbox when creating the allocation. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**Hard Allocation**: The team member has been \\\\\\\"confirmed\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"booked\\\\\\\" to work on the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Soft Allocation: **The team member or unnamed resource is tentatively 'penciled in' to work on the project. An unnamed resource or **placeholder **is always soft-allocated. \\\\n\\\\n### Assignment\\\\n \\\\nThe amount of work [time] assigned for a user. \\\\n\\\\n### Estimate\\\\n \\\\nThe estimated amount of work [time] an action will take to complete\\\\n\\\\n### Placeholder\\\\n \\\\nPlaceholders are unnamed resources used to 'pencil in' who will work on a project or activity. Like your users, placeholders are assigned roles (i.e Copywriter) and can be used to assign work without knowing who on your team will take it. \\\\n\\\\n# \\\\n\\\\n# Settings & User Profiles\\\\n\\\\nTo make the most out of Resourcing, it is important to review Resourcing Settings. \\\\n\\\\nFound by clicking ‘More’ in the top right corner, the settings panel allows you to set thresholds, define how data is shown, and create placeholders, which are a key function of Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\nThe following sections will give an in-depth overview of each tab and how the settings can be used. \\\\n\\\\n## Resourcing Settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n### General\\\\n \\\\nThe ‘General’ tab allows you to set defaults for the workspace. By default, working days are 8 hours and the threshold (the division between blue (in-range) and red (over-indexed)) is set to 8 hours per day.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nIf a user’s Work Week days are not specified at the user level, Hive will refer to the values set in the Threshold to determine their availability. If the Threshold is not configured, Hive will default to the Working Days value.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nIf your team works weekends or another configuration of days, you can note it from this screen. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nOn-screen numerical figures can be shown as hours or utilization percentages. 100% utilization is defined by your threshold. This can be adjusted by the toggles as well. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nLastly, permissions determine who can see and interact with the Resourcing applet. If you set permissions to 'Specific Users', other users will not see Resourcing under Apps. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### Placeholders\\\\n \\\\nDo you know a Project Manager needs to take the work but are unsure which one? Use a Placeholder! \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nPlaceholder roles are defined in Resourcing and allow you to assign or resource work when the exact resource is not yet known. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nNote that you will need to assign a corresponding role to your Placeholder like you would with a regular employee. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### Projects\\\\n \\\\nThe Projects tab allows you to add Project Tags to your projects for further filtering in Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nProject Tags are optional and different from Project Custom Fields. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nProject tags are useful to align filters within the Resourcing and Time Applets where you can filter the grid and report views based on the same project tag values.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### People\\\\n \\\\nThe people tab allows you to assign your team Roles and User Tags (discussed below). \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nBoth of these items can also be assigned to a User’s profile by an Admin. \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n### Roles\\\\n \\\\nRoles generally follow job titles in an organization.

We're going to walk through how to configure Hive's Resourcing module, so you can start uncovering these insights and drive some change in your organization!\\\\n\\\\n Note:** It's preferable that you're starting with your projects already created & entered in Hive, so check out one of our other Workflow guides if you haven't completed that step yet! \\\\n\\\\n# ** Step 1: Turn on Resourcing in Hive Apps**\\\\n\\\\nHead to Apps on the left-hand panel and toggle on Resourcing:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Pick your Resourcing \\\\\\\"Zoom Level\\\\\\\" **🔎 :** where do you currently estimate effort for your team's work?**\\\\n \\\\n## Pick which is closest to what your team does.\\\\n\\\\n## a) It's at the task-level - we estimate how long each step in our plan will take, which allows us to be granular.\\\\n \\\\nIn this case, we recommend that Timetracking is also toggled on in Hive Apps so that you can enter estimates onto action cards within your plans. \\\\n\\\\nTo reiterate, task-based estimates are added per person, per action card\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates are usually more granular and are always attached to specific actionable to-dos. Remember actions are things that people can \\\\\\\"do\\\\\\\" & check off their list\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe estimates will follow the project plan, so shifts in the project plan automatically update your Resourcing view\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates appear as guidance for individuals about their allocated time, when they look at My Actions view.\\\\n \\\\nGo to each action card where you want to enter time, and use the Estimates section to add the time. Remember to add the due date to the card, so it will be visible within Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\n**b) If at the Project-level, you will be using resource assignments: estimates are added per person, at the project level.**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis is typically used as broader \\\\\\\"buckets\\\\\\\" of time for blocking out people's availability in assignments when the exact tasks are not known or the level of granularity is too much to maintain for the team\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nResource assignments do not appear in My Actions View - they are not things to be 'completed'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThey do not move with project plan updates\\\\n\\\\nGo to the Resourcing View, and double-click onto the individual's line where you want to add the estimate. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdjust the effort\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the dates\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRemember to confirm! (This sends the user a notification)\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Do you resource by team? **\\\\n \\\\n## Do your team members have assigned teams that you may want to quickly filter to - i.e., show me the Design Team's workload?\\\\n\\\\n**Yes? ** Create teams & set all employees' teams in the Workspace Setting: click on your profile icon, click Settings, navigate to Teams, click the blue \\\\\\\"Create new team\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Does your team have specific roles or special skills?**\\\\n \\\\na) Yes! Great, you can go to the Resourcing Setting, go to People, search for a user, click on their name, and then you'll be able to update the user role or User Tag.\\\\n\\\\nIf you require a user’s role to be modified for a particular project, the Admin or Project Owner can make the necessary adjustments on the Overview page.\\\\n\\\\nb) No, teams is specific enough for my resourcing view. --> No action needed!\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Do you need to allocate time before you know who can take on the work?**\\\\n \\\\nIf so, Placeholders are going to assist in making this possible. A placeholder, like \\\\\\\"Copywriter\\\\\\\" for instance, allows you to assign a task without knowing yet who on your team will take the work. You can see allocations to Placeholders in Resourcing so you know how much work is coming up for a particular team. \\\\n\\\\nTo create Placeholders, head to the More > Settings menu in Resourcing and add from there. \\\\n\\\\nThen, on your projects, select the Placeholders you want to include in that project in the Edit Project Screen:\\\\n\\\\nThen finally, assign the action card to the Placeholder Assignee:\\\\n \\\\n *Note: You can also assign an action card to a Placeholder and a User to an action card! \\\\n\\\\nIf the Estimated time you added exceeds the available hours of the team member who is assigned to this action, you'll be notified that \\\\\\\"This change exceeds <User> availability on <Date>\\\\\\\". User availability is determined based on the user’s Work week hours. This section can be accessed by going to Resourcing > User Profile.\\\\n\\\\nIf the user’s workweek hours are not provided, Hive will utilize the Threshold value specified in the Resourcing settings. In the absence of a Threshold value, Hive will default to the Working day value.\\\\n\\\\n# **Finally, you're ready for the big step **💪 :** Notifying your team of the new resourcing process**\\\\n \\\\nWe think it's best to call a Team Meeting with anyone involved or impacted by the Resourcing workflow (you can always use our guide for Running Great Meetings ). \\\\n\\\\nMake sure you agree on the motions of resourcing your team:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWill you add Estimates & using Placeholders in your Project Templates so you don't need to reinvent the wheel when a new project kicks-off\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow will you deal with overallocation (will people work more hours, or will timelines shift, or will more headcount be required)?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCan everyone see Resourcing, or do you need to restrict visibility for any reason? Review that setting here . \\\\n\\\\n Staffing your team appropriately is both art & science, and we're here to provide the platform to host these great masterpieces! \\\\n Related Articles Time Tracking Quick-Start Guide Using placeholders Adding placeholder resources to projects Resourcing 2.0 - Comprehensive Overview  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 6102\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"hivemind\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"HiveMind / Buzz AI\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"AI assistant integrated across Action Cards, Notes, Mail, and project creation.

But, many teams have custom data that they need to track. This could include:\\\\n \\\\nProject category or type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRegion or office supporting this project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLink to Figma file in a design action card\\\\n \\\\nIf you have specific data you want to track, Hive allows you to create custom fields at both the action and project level.\\\\n\\\\n# Creating action** custom fields\\\\n \\\\nYou will see action custom fields inside each action card within the project that contains that custom field. These custom fields are also visible in Table view.\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'More'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Custom fields'\\\\n \\\\n4. It will open a modal. Click the 'Create new custom field' button   5. Type the name of the field you want to add, select the field type and save\\\\n\\\\nAction custom fields have seven different field type options:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nText: Text entry field \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect: Dropdown selection field, either single- or multi-select, giving users options to select\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUser: User dropdown allowing you to pick a user's name in your Hive workspace \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDate: Dropdown calendar\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject: Dropdown Projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFormula: Create a formula based on other data values\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNumber: Number entry field\\\\n\\\\nNow that I have created my action card custom field 'Maintenance Level', any action I open within my East Project where the custom field is turned on, will have the option on the action cards, shown here:\\\\n\\\\n# Reordering Custom Field Options\\\\n \\\\nWith the list options, you can drag to re-order the options in the drop-down using the grabber bars:\\\\n\\\\n# Creating project custom fields\\\\n \\\\nYou can create and view project custom fields on the Overview page of each project. These custom fields are also visible in the Project Navigator, and you can view them in Portfolio View.\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Overview' (this can also be done from the 'More' button)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect '+ Add new custom field' under 'Project custom fields'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect your field type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType in the field name and select options, if applicable\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick 'Save and add'\\\\n \\\\nYou can update the custom field input from the project Overview page or from Project Navigator.\\\\n\\\\nOn the project Overview page:\\\\n\\\\nOn Project Navigator:\\\\n\\\\nClick on the 3 dots to show project custom fields on Project navigator, and select which ones you want to view. It is also possible to sort your projects alphabetically by the custom fields you select as well as filter them by custom field value. This only impacts your view of Hive:\\\\n\\\\n# Editing Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFrom the Project view, go to 'More' -> 'Custom fields' in the project you want to change\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis opens a modal with a list of your custom fields \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo edit, select the pencil icon. Type in the changes you want to make to the label and press enter\\\\n \\\\nAdmin users have the ability to edit or delete existing custom fields, regardless of who created them. Non-admins are able to create custom fields, but will only be able to edit or delete the ones they have created.\\\\n\\\\n# Deleting Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFrom the Project view, go to 'More' -> 'Custom fields' in the project you want to change\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis opens a modal with a list of your custom fields \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo delete, select the 3-dot icon, select Delete\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChoose \\\\\\\"Delete custom field but keep existing instances\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Delete custom field from all actions\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\nNote:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n \\\\\\\"Delete custom field but keep existing instances\\\\\\\" - This option deletes the custom field from your workspace but if the custom field had any value in it, then that custom field will still be visible.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n \\\\\\\"Delete custom field from all actions\\\\\\\" - This option deleted the custom field from your workspace completely and even the custom fields that had values will be deleted.\\\\n\\\\n# Accessing Custom Field Library\\\\n \\\\nOnce a custom field has been created, it is accessible by the entire workspace. Both project and action custom fields can be turned on or off in individual projects, depending on the additional information you wish to capture within that project.\\\\n\\\\nTo access this library within a project go to More > Custom Fields. You will then be able to toggle On/Off individual fields for the project.\\\\n \\\\nHowever, you can also add custom fields to or remove them from multiple projects/templates as well if you need to do that in bulk. Just click on the number of projects under the Used in column.\\\\n\\\\n# Group your Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\nGrouping the custom fields together is especially helpful when working with large sets of related fields — such as financial or integration-specific fields — reducing the risk of missing key data.\\\\n\\\\n**To create a custom field group:**\\\\n\\\\n1. Navigate to your profile icon at the top right \\\\n \\\\n2. Find Settings in the dropdown\\\\n \\\\n3. Open the Custom Fields section\\\\n \\\\n4. Select the Action card fields or Project fields section\\\\n \\\\n5. Use the Create group option.\\\\n\\\\n**To add a custom field to the group, you can use one of the following ways:**\\\\n \\\\n 1. Edit the existing custom field & move it under the desired group.\\\\n\\\\n2. Create a new custom field & move it under the desired group.\\\\n\\\\n3. Edit the group & bulk-add multiple custom fields to the group:\\\\n \\\\nYou can also easily rearrange groups and fields within each group using simple drag-and-drop!\\\\n\\\\n# Using Custom Fields Groupings\\\\n \\\\nOnce the custom field group is created, you will enable it for your specific project/-s. You can do this using one of the following ways:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDirectly from the Workspace Settings > Custom Fields section\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nToggle on the individual fields on the project level\\\\n\\\\nAfterward, you'll see your custom field grouping appear directly in the action card/project Overview page. The section can be easily expanded/hidden for quick access!\\\\n\\\\nPlease note: Groupings cannot be edited or reordered within action cards.\\\\n Related Articles Hive Forms External Users Dynamic Fields in Hive Forms Create a Jira issue from Hive Multiple conditions in Salesforce triggers  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 6348\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Formula Custom Fields\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5920917-formula-custom-fields\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Formula Custom Fields | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Custom Fields Formula Custom Fields \\\\n# Formula Custom Fields\\\\n \\\\nDynamically calculate custom fields\\\\n A Written by Alexander Heldring Updated over 3 years ago  \\\\nFormula custom fields allow you to create relationships between custom fields using simple or advanced formulas. \\\\n\\\\nFor example, if you have two existing custom fields ('Cost per person' and 'Number of people') you could create a formula custom field ('Total cost') to multiply their values. \\\\n\\\\nFormula custom fields are available for both project and action custom fields.

Ensure your Project Template has a Project Start/Due Date**\\\\n \\\\nCheck that your template has a project start and/or due date. This acts as a link between your project template and any new projects created from this template to ensure that action durations and dependencies transfer over to the new project properly.\\\\n\\\\n**Pro-tip**: Ensure your **new** project also has a project start and/or due date at creation. If your template has a project start/due date, then when creating a new project from the template the project start/due date will automatically be populated for the new project.\\\\n\\\\n## **2. Assign actions to Placeholders**\\\\n \\\\nAssign the actions in your template to Placeholders . Using Placeholders in your template will allow for efficient updates to the actual resources that will be working on those actions in your project. \\\\n\\\\nBefore you can assign actions to Placeholders, check the Template Project Settings page to make sure Placeholders have been added to the Template. Once added to the Template, then Placeholders can be assigned to actions.\\\\n\\\\n## **3. Add durations and dependencies to your actions**\\\\n \\\\nWhile not required, ensuring that the action cards in the Project Template have relative due dates, durations, and dependencies is a best practice for optimizing Project Templates. \\\\n\\\\nWhile you may not know the exact duration for every action in your project, it is still recommended to add approximate start and end dates for each action. That way when applying the template, each action has a starting point to work from when shaping the project plan for the new project.\\\\n\\\\n## **4. Manage Labels and Apply them to Necessary Action Cards**\\\\n \\\\n Labels are a great way to manage key initiatives or categorize certain actions for designated teams. \\\\n\\\\nProject Templates can be pre-set to not only limit which labels are available in the project, but also to have labels pre-applied on action cards. That way when the template is applied for a new project, the action cards in the project come pre-set with their applicable labels helping to maintain project consistency and completeness.\\\\n\\\\n## 5. Grant access to the Project Template to Hive Teams\\\\n \\\\nIn addition to making sure members of a Hive Team have access to a template, members of the Project Template are listed by default in the Project Membership section when new projects are created using the template.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, inviting Teams rather than individuals to templates helps to ensure template membership is kept up to date as team membership changes. New members added to a Hive Team will automatically be granted access to templates and projects where the Hive Team is a member.\\\\n\\\\n## **6. Review your Project Settings**\\\\n \\\\nWhen a project template is used to create a new project, the template's project setting will apply as the default settings for the new project. Therefore, it is important to check that the project and auto-scheduling settings on the project template are appropriate.\\\\n\\\\nIn the project Permission settings, you can define who can edit, apply, and access\\\\n \\\\nthe project template.\\\\n\\\\nPro-tip: In your Workspace Settings, you can also select the project template you'd like to be automatically applied by default each time a new project is created.\\\\n\\\\nChecking that your Project Templates have the above items will set them up for success!\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Action templates Project templates Adding placeholder resources to projects Run a modern agency on Hive New This Week in Hive: August 2021  😞 😐 😃 Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3943\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"gantt\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Gantt Charts & Timeline Management\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Timeline visualization with dependencies, auto-scheduling (standard and strict), critical path, project baselines, date highlighting for what-if scenarios, bulk selection, column customization, zoom, fullscreen, and export to PDF/PNG/XLS.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 3,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 7536,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Gantt Charts\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/694618-gantt-charts\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Gantt charts | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Using Hive Projects Gantt charts \\\\n# Gantt charts\\\\n \\\\nThe easiest way to plan your project\\\\n A Written by Alexander Heldring Updated over 5 months ago  \\\\nGantt charts have been around for a long time - what was missing was the ability to actually use** the Gantt chart to execute your project.\\\\n\\\\nWith Gantt charts, Hive allows you to **plan** and **execute** your project, all in the same tool. Let's take a look.\\\\n\\\\n# Create a Project in Gantt View\\\\n \\\\nGo to the project navigator and select +New Project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGive it a title and add description, due date, and attachments as needed\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect sharing settings (you can read more about that here )\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChoose 'Gantt View' as your project layout and select create\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIt should open your new Gantt project. Click +Add an action, type the name, and press enter. Just click on the Gantt chart to give it a start date and deadline. See it in action in the GIF below.\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nIn no time, your project plan is all set up! \\\\n \\\\n# Updating Gantt View\\\\n \\\\nOnce you've created a Gantt view, there are lots of ways to customize it for your needs.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing the timeline\\\\n \\\\nGantt view is defaulted to show you a timeline of several months, but you can change it. You can zoom in to look a few weeks or zoom out to look at a project over a whole year.\\\\n\\\\n## Going fullscreen\\\\n \\\\nIf you want to make your Gantt view bigger, you can expand it to cover your whole screen.\\\\n\\\\n## Changing assignees\\\\n \\\\n## \\\\n \\\\n## Marking complete\\\\n\\\\n## Hiding subactions\\\\n\\\\n## Add dates\\\\n \\\\nThere are different ways to add dates to your actions in Gantt view! You can click on the needed cell on the timeline or use our Gantt Table to select dates from the date picker.\\\\n\\\\nPro-tip: to easily update multiple actions with a new date, you can simply copy the date cell on Gantt Table and paste it into the needed one.\\\\n\\\\n## Add Dependencies \\\\n \\\\nClick circle and drag to the beginning of the next action\\\\n\\\\n## Expand your Actions\\\\n \\\\nCheck out the counter and expand/collapse each layer of your subactions. Use additional options in the dropdown to Expand all or Collapse all.\\\\n\\\\n## Wrapping Column Text\\\\n \\\\nRight-click on the title of the action card then choose the \\\\\\\"Wrap column text\\\\\\\".\\\\n \\\\nThis will make the text wrap around in the column.\\\\n\\\\n## Add colors\\\\n \\\\nTo make your Gantt more customizable and visually appealing, as well as create better organization, you can change the color of action card bars.\\\\n\\\\nTo do that, right-click the desired action and select a color. The color will automatically override any label colors from actions, and apply to all project views and summary views. \\\\n\\\\n## Displaying Percentage Completion\\\\n \\\\nIf you wish to display the percentage completion of your parent action card by its subactions, you can enable the “Display percent complete” option in the Configure settings.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also set this percentage completion manually by changing the \\\\\\\"Display percent complete\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"Manually Update\\\\\\\", and then drag the icon to change the percentage.\\\\n\\\\n## Hide/show elements\\\\n \\\\nNavigate to Filters to customize your view and hide or show elements such as milestones, actions, and sections. The \\\\\\\"Show\\\\\\\" dropdown under the Display section will allow you to better visualize independent goals within Gantt. ​\\\\n\\\\n## Highlight changes\\\\n \\\\nWhen a date is changed, you'll see Hive highlighting action start/due dates that were changed as well.\\\\n\\\\nThis makes it easier for your team — specifically project managers — to run \\\\\\\"What if\\\\\\\" scenarios in Gantt before taking action. ​ The highlight will disappear when you change a new date or leave the project & come back in.\\\\n\\\\n## Select multiple actions in Gantt\\\\n \\\\nIn Gantt, you can hover over the action row to find the checkbox, which will help bulk-select action cards and update multiple automatically.\\\\n\\\\n Another way is holding Shift to select all actions in between!\\\\n\\\\n## Settings\\\\n \\\\nYou can also customize your Gantt view and enable or disable different columns based on your needs. These include Status, Start and End date, Duration, Predecessor, Assignee, Labels, Estimate, Total time Tracked and Custom Fields.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have the Duration column enabled, you can see the total project duration which can be extremely handy. The duration is calculated based on the start date of the first action, the due date of the last action, and the number of working days between those days.\\\\n\\\\n## Export \\\\n \\\\nFrom Gantt view you can export to PDF, PNG, Microsoft Project, CSV, Excel, and Excel Chart as well as adjust export settings.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Creating Dependencies Project Baselines Using Hive's Gantt Chart Layout Undo in Gantt Home View: List View (New)!  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 4661\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Critical Path\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/3341605-critical-path\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Critical Path | Hive Help \\\\n•    Using Hive Projects Critical Path \\\\n# Critical Path\\\\n \\\\nCritical path shows the shortest time to complete a project based on important actions in your project plan\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 2 years ago \\\\n To view the critical path of your project, start in the 'Gantt' project view.

To use it, you have to turn it on in your Apps first.\\\\n\\\\n# Creating your goal\\\\n \\\\nAfter turning on the app, you'll be able to create your first goal. You can add such details as Name of your Goal, Owner, Time range, and Goal measurement.\\\\n\\\\n It's possible to measure your goal based on Actions completed (automatic tracking based on action card completion) or Number (manual tracking and updating your goal).\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to track your goal based on completed or overdue actions, you'll get an option to choose either or individual actions as your progress source. From there, you'll be able to select your projects/actions as well as the parent goal if applicable (this new goal will be added as a sub-goal). If you go for 'Selected Actions', you'll see the checkbox to include subactions too. Lastly, you can display your goal as a Progress Bar (shows the percentage of completion) or Current Value (shows the current number of completed actions). \\\\n\\\\nIf you'd like to track your progress manually instead, you can select Number under Goal measurement and then add your Unit of measurement. Available options include Percentage, Currency, or your custom unit. Then you'll get to enter Initial value, Current value, and Goal value. You can also select your parent goal and choose the display type. \\\\n\\\\n# Viewing details and making edits\\\\n \\\\nAfter creating your goal, click on it to see all the details and add or edit things like description, subgoals, projects, and more. Please keep in mind that if your goal is tracked based on completed actions, incomplete actions will always show up at the top. \\\\n\\\\nYou can also change the status of your goal. Hit 'Update status' and voila!\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to see your goal activity, scroll down a little bit and you'll be able to see it just beneath your subgoals. Click 'Show full history' to see it entirely. \\\\n\\\\nWhen you need to reassign goal ownership to someone else, you can do it by clicking on the Owner dropdown. \\\\n\\\\nThe new assignee will get a notification like this: \\\\n\\\\n# Chart view\\\\n \\\\nAnother cool feature available in Goals is the ability to see your goal in Chart view. Click the 3 dots icon in the top right corner > Chart View to give it a try.\\\\n\\\\n# Additional functionality\\\\n \\\\nFrom the same 3 dot menu, you can request status update on your goal (and subgoals) as well as delete it. Please note that once you delete a goal, it cannot be undone.\\\\n\\\\n ​\\\\n \\\\n# Export your Goal\\\\n\\\\nTo easily export and further analyze your Goals, navigate to the Export button at the top of the screen. The Goal data will be exported in CSV. ​\\\\n\\\\n# Visualize goals over time\\\\n \\\\nYou can also view your Goals over time in the Dashboards app to better track progress and spot trends.\\\\n\\\\nIn the Dashboards app, create one of the Chart widgets and set it to report on Goals. From there, you can configure the widget further and create a Goal target line that adjusts to reflect your target, ensuring you can visually compare progress against your goal, even if the values differ. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Gantt charts How to Automate a Goal How to set 'Status ranges' in Goals Financial Reporting in Dashboards Dashboard Widgets  😞 😐 😃 Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3470\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"agile\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Agile & Sprints\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Agile project management using Status View for sprint boards, Epics as parent projects, stories as action cards, sprint planning with summary views, and team reporting.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 1,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 2541,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Agile Epics & Sprints\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/6804100-how-to-approach-epics-with-hive-agile\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"How to approach Epics with Hive Agile. | Hive Help \\\\n• **    Use Cases How to approach Epics with Hive Agile. \\\\n# How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.\\\\n \\\\nSupport your agile methodology in Hive with Epics.\\\\n Written by Dee Miller Updated over a year ago \\\\nUsing the Hive Agile Workflow , team members will have greater visibility into their sprints. \\\\n\\\\n Epics** are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks known as **Stories**. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Initiatives **or **Projects** are collections of epics that drive toward a common goal. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAn organization may also have **themes** which are large focus areas that span the organization.\\\\n\\\\nTypically, a team will commit to finishing a story within a one- or two-week sprint. Epics, generally, are fewer in number and take longer to complete. Completing epics is usually worked towards per quarter, where a team may aim to complete two or three. \\\\n\\\\nLet's take the below example of an agile working structure including epics and look at how this can be represented in Hive.\\\\n\\\\n**Recommendations:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Nest your Epic projects under the Initiative projects to ensure your project navigator is well organized. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThemes can be presented with Sections or Labels in the projects. This will support filtering and sorting in reports in Summary View. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLeverage Action Custom Fields , which include an available date field option, to capture release information. These can also be sorted and filtered for reporting in Summary View. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCustomize the project Statuses to reflect the different stages of your workflow, including a Backlog status for example. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd a story point to each action, this will carry over into agile reports and help with velocity calculations. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUse sprints to pull actions together across multiple projects and quickly see progress.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreate Hive Teams for each agile team to enable team reporting and grouping.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreate different report layouts (see below). \\\\n\\\\n**Epics View Example (Portfolio View):**\\\\n \\\\nCreate an overview of your Epics to manage Initiatives and underlying projects.\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Dashboard App Example (Dashboard App):**\\\\n \\\\nLeverage the Hive Dashboard app for a custom dashboard of project visuals and reports.\\\\n\\\\n**Initiative View Example (Parent Project / Summary View):**\\\\n \\\\nView your Initiative in a visual roadmap using Gantt View.\\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Understanding Hive's Platform Hive 2.0 Template Library Run a modern agency on Hive Agile Sprints Hive Best Practices  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 2541\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"reporting\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"Reporting, Dashboards & Analytics\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Dashboard widgets (Chart Builder, Timeline, Goals, Notes, Embed, Image, Actions List, Projects List, Text, Button, Section Header, Risk & Issues, Pivot Table).

It's especially useful for managers and other people who want to take a look at the big picture across their teams and projects. Common use cases are: ​ To create a summary view:\\\\n \\\\nGo to the Project Navigator \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick Summary Views \\\\n\\\\n3. Click the button for '+ Create summary view' 4. In the new window that opens up, you can select the settings and what information you'd like to check out in your summary view. These include:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n View type - List, Status, Team, Calendar, Gantt and Table View\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nShare with: Define who is able to see the summary view.

Just click the 'Filters' option in the Summary View menu.\\\\n\\\\nThis will open up a list of configure options, where you can select how your Summary view is filtered. You can filter by:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssignees\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBlocked actions\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreated by\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLabels\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPriority Levels\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProjects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nStatuses\\\\n \\\\nYou can also sort by priority level and reveal actions that you have archived using the checkbox for Archived actions.\\\\n\\\\nAny filters you set will only apply to your view.

Read on for how to customize this for you. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, Portfolio View is a Hive App - read about how to toggle them on & pin them here .\\\\n\\\\nTo access it, click on the Portfolio View text in the left-hand panel. Once you click on that, you will end up in a space like this: \\\\n\\\\n## Components of Portfolio View: Projects, Details & Actions\\\\n \\\\nYou can build a Portfolio view your way, including these 3 building blocks:\\\\n \\\\nThe \\\\\\\"Projects\\\\\\\" dropdown will allow you to select which projects you'd like to see. You can click 'Select all' to have all of your projects added if that's what you need. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe dropdown for \\\\\\\"Project Fields\\\\\\\" allows you to pull in project fields and custom fields.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe dropdown that says \\\\\\\"Actions\\\\\\\" allows you to pull in the status of the actions and subactions that are living across projects listed on the left. The due date for those actions appears, and a checkmark if they are completed. Within the \\\\\\\"Actions\\\\\\\" dropdown, you can decide if you want to see specific milestones, too!\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, we have four project fields pulling in: Status, Description, Project due date, and Project Owner. Status and Description fields can be edited directly from this view - simply double click on the cell next to the needed project! ​\\\\n \\\\n Other fields can be edited within the \\\\\\\"Overview\\\\\\\" button of a project. Just click on the project in the table and click \\\\\\\"Overview\\\\\\\" toward the top right.\\\\n\\\\nActions pulled into the portfolio view will show a due date if they're incomplete, a green check if they're complete, or \\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\" if the action card doesn't exist yet in one of the selected projects. \\\\n\\\\nMilestone actions pulled into Portfolio View will show the date they are due along with the flag icon to indicate that it has been set as a milestone in the project. If an action is set as a milestone in one project, but the same action lives in another and it's not set as a milestone, the difference will be the flag icon beside the date to show where it's a milestone. \\\\n\\\\n## Create, Save & Share:\\\\n \\\\nIf you manage more than one portfolio, and would like quicker access to it, now you can save the view.\\\\n\\\\nTo do so, click the Title of the Portfolio View and create a new one. Now both are available in your drop down!\\\\n\\\\nTo share a view with others, head to the Menu > Share icon on the right:\\\\n\\\\nAnd add your teammates:\\\\n\\\\n### Share a read-only public link to your Portfolio view\\\\n \\\\nWhen Access type is set to 'Anyone with a link', you can copy the share link to your Portfolio view and send it to your stakeholders.\\\\n\\\\nTo share a public link to a filtered Portfolio view, Workspace Admins and Portfolio owner ** can use the 'Lock editing' button at the top of the screen. \\\\n\\\\nWhen enabled, only Workspace Admins and Portfolio owner can filter in the Portfolio View.\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** The Global icon on your Portfolio view means that the view is shared publicly and any filter changes you make will be reflected in the public view as well.\\\\n\\\\nPortfolio View is best leveraged when looking at multiple projects that have the same action cards and/or custom fields because you can then compare those projects accurately and efficiently. \\\\n\\\\n## How to remove a project from Portfolio View\\\\n \\\\nTo remove a project from a portfolio view, you can select the project and toggle off the button next to the project title.\\\\n\\\\n There's more to discover with Portfolio View, so check out this related post: https://hive.com/blog/portfolio-view/ \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Gantt charts Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive List View: A New Project View in Hive Home View: List View (New)!  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 3992\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    \\\"user_management\\\": {\\r\\n      \\\"feature_name\\\": \\\"User & Team Management\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Invite users, manage Teams, external users (single project access), client mode, workspace sharing, permissions, and role management.\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"article_count\\\": 3,\\r\\n      \\\"total_content_chars\\\": 10890,\\r\\n      \\\"articles\\\": [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Adding People to Workspace\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/1519549-adding-people-into-your-workspace\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"# Adding people into your workspace\\\\n \\\\nHive works best with a team!

To do that, go to More, then click \\\\\\\"Enable Client Mode\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nOnce this feature is enabled, all actions in the project will have an external users toggle on the top of the card which indicates if the card is either private to the internal team, or visible to external users. All action cards will be private to the internal team by default.\\\\n\\\\n Once the toggle is enabled, external users will be able to see and access the card.\\\\n\\\\n# External Users and Hive Messaging:\\\\n \\\\nExternal Users may direct messages with users that are members of projects where they are also a member.\\\\n\\\\nExternal Users may not be added to group chats, but they will be a member of a group chat created from a project where they are a member.

It breaks down a project into manageable chunks and allows project managers to define and organize the scope of their project in an organized manner. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) also provides an effective way to track project progress and identify dependencies. ​\\\\n \\\\nYou can use WBS while importing a CSV to define action hierarchies and/or predecessors. The structure is as follows: \\\\n\\\\naction.subaction...\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if a row had a WBS value of '3.1' that would mean it is the first subaction of the third action in the list. \\\\n\\\\nIf you import a project with the following WBS: \\\\n\\\\nThen in Hive, it will look like this: \\\\n\\\\nNotice that the action with WBS '3.1.1' is the third level in the action hierarchy. Like actions, there is no limit to the amount of nesting that can be created in a work breakdown structure. \\\\n\\\\nWBS also allows us to create dependencies in CSV imports. If you have a 'Predecessor' column in your CSV, you can reference an actions WBS to create a dependency. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example, once the CSV is imported into Hive Action 2 would be dependent on Action 1 and so on. \\\\n\\\\nNote that 'WBS' and 'Predecessor' are optional columns in the CSV import. If WBS is not present, then all rows will be imported as top level actions. If WBS is present but Predecessors is not, actions will be created in the hierarchy dictated by their WBS but no dependencies will be present. \\\\n\\\\nQuestions about WBS or importing a CSV?

Use this quick-start guide to get started in Hive and optimize your project flow and structure.\\\\n\\\\nDo any of these issues sound familiar?\\\\n \\\\nI don't understand the macro-level initiatives my company is planning.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nI don't know who is working on what tasks within a larger projects.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat's the next step after I complete this small task?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCan I see a high-level view of what's going on in the organization?\\\\n \\\\n# Step 1: Define the Initiative **\\\\n \\\\nIf you can relate to any of the questions above, this article is for you. Let's first think about the types of initiatives your team is taking on. Which of the following are they?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Micro-level: On-going, repeatable initiatives that exist within a department** (i.e. HR team onboarding, legal team reviewing materials for sign-off)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Macro-level: Department initiatives undergone to achieve KPIs**\\\\n \\\\nGood news -- you can tackle both of these initiatives in Hive. Once you understand the type of initiative you're working on, you can get started on the moving parts and tasks within.\\\\n\\\\nFirst we need to ask ourselves a few questions. To start, we want to better understand how your team has learned about this initiative.\\\\n\\\\nWas it...\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTriggered by an event in the company\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAn ongoing project that your team is running for the company \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA repeatable tasks that exists or pops-up every week\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA response to requests from other teams or departments \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGiven to the team by leadership\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Sketch It Out in Hive**\\\\n \\\\nOnce we understand what triggered the event, we can take the appropriate actions in Hive. \\\\n\\\\n**If the task was triggered by an event in the company:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreate a new project in Hive for the initiative or task and invite all relevant team members from your organization.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo add a new project, click the \\\\\\\"New\\\\\\\" button in the upper right-hand corner of your Hive window and select New Project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nYou'll need to add teammates to your project. To do this, click the \\\\\\\"Edit Project\\\\\\\" button in Hive and press the \\\\\\\"Add project members\\\\\\\". They'll now be able to access and visualize this initiative.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf there are relevant documents or additional information, you can attach them in the Project Overview. Access Project Overview by clicking the Overview button when you're inside the project.\\\\n \\\\nAnother component of Hive that you might want to utilize if a task is triggered by an event in the company is Sections.\\\\n\\\\nEvery project goes through a process from start to finish. In some industries, this process is marked by stages. For example, a consulting project might have three section: planning, execution, and closing.\\\\n \\\\n**To use sections in Hive:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen adding sections to a new project **, go to the project navigator, select \\\\\\\"+ New Project\\\\\\\", create the project, click More menu at the top right corner, then scroll down to find the Section, then click \\\\\\\"Add section\\\\\\\".\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you create a new action, it ** adds it to the New section by default **. You change an action's section by clicking the dropdown menu at the top of the action card.\\\\n \\\\nOnce you've set up Sections, you can use them in a few ways:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFilter all actions in Kanban by status\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nView actions broken down by sections in Gantt view\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn Gantt view, you can also group actions by section\\\\n \\\\n**If the task is an ongoing project that your team is running for the company:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis setup is going to look largely the same as the previous, except you will be adding tasks to a preexisting project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf you need to add team members to the project, click the \\\\\\\"Edit Project\\\\\\\" button in Hive and add \\\\\\\"Members\\\\\\\" to your project. They'll now be able to access and visualize this initiative.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo add team members to the specific task, you can either tag them in the comments of the action card, or add them as followers by clicking the blue plus sign on the bottom right hand corner.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf the task is part of a collection of tasks that can all be created using the same framework, it could be beneficial to use Hive Templates.\\\\n \\\\nWith templates, you can easily create built-out action cards that have pre-existing content, making it easier for your teammates to understand next steps and action items.\\\\n\\\\nTo access Hive Templates:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to your main menu (upper right corner under your profile picture)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"Workspace Settings\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Templates\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"+ Create New Action Template\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nName the template and provide a label if desired\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the subactions, assignees, days, and durations. It will look something like the below. \\\\n \\\\nTo apply a Hive Template, simply open up the action card (or create a new one) and select \\\\\\\"Apply Action Template\\\\\\\" from the dropdown.\\\\n\\\\n**If it is a repeatable task that occurs weekly:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWithin your new project, add a task and set the individual action as recurring\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo make an action recurring, simply click on the \\\\\\\"Due Date\\\\\\\" section of the action card, and click \\\\\\\"Set Recurring\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n**If the task was in response to requests from other teams or departments:**\\\\n\\\\nThere are a few ways to digest tasks passed from a team or department. If the task is coming from another teammate, and you've received it over email, you can easily use Hive Mail to either:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Create a new task from the email.** To do this, simply click into the email from your Hive Mail inbox, then click the checkmark icon above the message. You’ll then be able to access it from My Actions.\\\\n \\\\n**Bonus:** Email threads linked to action cards are dynamic, so they will update with any additional replies that are sent or received. Anyone who has access to the action card will be able to view and reply to the linked messages, ensuring that everyone stays up to date with the latest.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Pull information in on the task from a Hive Form.** This is an easy way to intake project or task data in a repeatable fashion. \\\\n \\\\nHere's how to enable and utilize Hive Forms:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEnable \\\\\\\"Forms\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\"Hive Apps\\\\\\\" if it's not already enabled. Pin Forms to your left-hand navigation panel.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nForms will now be easily accessible. To create a new Form, simply click \\\\\\\"Create A New Form\\\\\\\" on the upper right hand corner.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUtilize the Form builder to compile the information for your Form.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSet where you want to receive the Form submissions. You can either receive each submission via email, or in a Hive action ( it will automatically create an action in Hive in the project and assigned to the person you select) \\\\n \\\\n Each form come with a link that you can share or post on a website. To access the link, scroll to the top of the form and you will see a white box with a link. Click the button \\\\\\\"copy\\\\\\\" to save it to your clipboard. \\\\n\\\\n**If the task was given to you by leadership:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf a task is passed down to you by leadership as part of a larger initiative, it's easy to add yourself to the existing project that they're working from.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nOnce you're in the project, you can work with them to learn more about project set-up, milestones, KPIs, and other components of the project.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIt would be helpful to view a macro-level initiative in Gantt view to better understand the tasks, dependencies, and any other moving parts that are involved.\\\\n \\\\nTo view a project in Gantt view, simply enter your project and click the \\\\\\\"Change Layout\\\\\\\" button on the top right. From the dropdown, select Gantt.For a clearer structure, you can group your actions by phases in the Gantt view; navigate to your view settings and select \\\\\\\"Group by Phase.\\\\\\\" Adjust these settings to visually organize your project into logical segments for better tracking.\\\\n\\\\nWithin Gantt view, you'll even be able to customize the tasks and projects to your liking. Here are a few things you can do:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Change the timeline** - Gantt view is defaulted to show you a timeline of several months, but you can change it. You can zoom in to look a a few weeks or zoom out to look at a project over a whole year or several years.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Go full screen** - If you want to make your Gantt view bigger, you can expand it to cover your whole screen.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Change assignees** - Easily assign yourself or your teammates tasks within the larger Gantt view by selecting the task and editing assignee.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Add dependencies** - Dependencies are tasks that depend on the completion of another to be started/completed themselves. To add a dependency, locate the circle on the right hand side of each task and drag to the beginning of the next action.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**Add milestones **- Milestones are an easy way to track major accomplishments in your project. They are generally used as a indicator to call out a significant event on your Gantt Chart such as a project launch, key deliverable, or presentation date. To add a milestone, click the flag icon to mark each task as a milestone within an action card. The milestone will then show up as a diamond on the Gantt chart.6. **Group by Phase** - Easily organize and view your project timeline by grouping tasks into phases. To group by phase, adjust your view settings and select \\\\\\\"Group by Phase.\\\\\\\" This functionality provides a clear overview of each project segment and allows for better timeline management.\\\\n \\\\n# **Step 3: Check Out The Big Picture**\\\\n \\\\nNow that we understand how projects can be set up in Hive, it's time to think about the big picture. How can we better understand what's going on in our projects as they progress? There are a few ways to do that in Hive.\\\\n\\\\n## Portfolio View\\\\n \\\\nFirst, there's Portfolio View. This view is the all-in-one place to see the detail of Project Navigator combined with the flexibility of a Table View. \\\\n\\\\nTo access Portfolio View, you'll need to turn it on in Hive Apps, which you can access under \\\\\\\"Apps\\\\\\\" on your left-hand side navigator. The beauty of Portfolio View is that it lets you view actions from across projects, actions, and subactions in once place. This is ideal for teammates who want to better understand how the big-picture is progressing and how initiatives are working together.\\\\n\\\\nTo create a Portfolio View:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFirst select the projects you want to include in the view from the \\\\\\\"Add projects\\\\\\\" dropdown.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect items from the dropdown for \\\\\\\"Project details and fields\\\\\\\" so you can better understand which items you'd like included in the Portfolio View.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nUtilize the dropdown that says \\\\\\\"Add actions and subactions\\\\\\\" to pull in the status of the actions and subactions that are living across projects listed on the left. The due date for those actions appears, and a checkmark if they are completed. Within the \\\\\\\"Actions and subactions\\\\\\\" dropdown, you can decide if you want to see specific milestones, too!\\\\n \\\\nIf you manage more than one portfolio, and would like quicker access to it, you can save the view, as well as add another Portfolio View. To do so, click the Title of the Portfolio View and create a new one. Now both are available in your drop down! \\\\n\\\\nTo share a view with others, head to the share icon on the right and add your teammates to the Portfolio View.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, Portfolio View is best leveraged when looking at multiple projects that have the same action cards and/or custom fields because you can then compare those projects accurately and efficiently.\\\\n \\\\n## **Dashboards\\\\n \\\\nDashboards are another way you can understand the big-picture and track tasks across the organization or team. To enable Dashboards, visits Hive Apps and toggle the Dashboards tile on.\\\\n\\\\nFrom there, you'll be able access your Workspace Overview **dashboard which will help you** **better understand progress across teams and your organization.\\\\n\\\\n## Risks and Issues Tracker\\\\n \\\\nAnother great tool that you can use in Hive to manage initiatives as they unfold is the risk and issues tracker functionality. \\\\n\\\\nTo turn on this aspect of Hive, simply visit Hive Apps and toggle on \\\\\\\"Risks and Issues Tracker.\\\\\\\" Your team can now use the tracker to manage the risks and issues in each of your projects in one centralized location.\\\\n\\\\nTo add a new issue, open the tracker and enter the name of the risk you would like to keep track of. Be sure to select the project the risk is associated with.\\\\n\\\\nIf project phases remain invisible, you can create a more streamlined view by enabling proper grouping settings. Under Gantt view, access the \\\\\\\"Configure settings\\\\\\\" and ensure that \\\\\\\"Phases\\\\\\\" is selected as the grouping option. Save the configuration to have clear visibility into each project phase.\\\\n \\\\nThe card is now linked with the project. To see it directly in the project, you can create a new Risks tab:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Time To Expand**\\\\n \\\\nNow that you've got your project running smoothly in Hive, it could be time to bring new project members into the fold. Maybe you need to show an external agency your progress, or maybe you're onboarding new team members.\\\\n\\\\n**External Users**\\\\n\\\\nWhen you've got external collaborators who need access to Hive, you can easily accomplish this through external users. External users are limited to the actions and messages within the assigned project and do not have access to your entire workspace.\\\\n \\\\n**​\\\\n \\\\n To add an external user:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick the \\\\\\\"Invite\\\\\\\" button on your project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe Invite New Members window will open. Select the tab that says \\\\\\\"Guest user.\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the email address of the person you want to invite and select the project(s) you want to add them to. After you click send invite, they will now have access to the project(s) you selected.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nTo add an external user to another project, go to the project’s homepage (you can get there by going into the project and clicking the “Home” button). Scroll to the very bottom to the External users section. Any existing external users for the project will be listed here. Click “+ Add external user.\\\\\\\"\\\\n \\\\n**Onboarding Additional Teams**\\\\n\\\\nIt's easy to add additional team members to your Hive workspace. To do so, simply press the \\\\\\\"Invite\\\\\\\" button on your home screen and enter your teammates email. From there, you'll be able to add them to the project that are relevant to their work. Hive will then notify the user!\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Optimize your Meetings**\\\\n \\\\nIf your team meets or regroups on the initiatives, leverage Hive Notes to plan the meeting, collaborate during the meeting, and convert 'next steps' in action items in your project.\\\\n\\\\nShare the Hive Note with other Hive users to collaborate in real-time on the meeting Note or share it externally as an email with non-Hive users or leadership to keep them informed. \\\\n\\\\nIf you have new action items from the team meetings, you can write them out, highlight them, and then click the checkmark icon and this will create new action cards directly in your project so the team won’t lose track. The best part is that the status, owner\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 15375\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Manage Complex Timelines\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755427-manage-complex-project-timelines\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Manage complex project timelines | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Manage complex project timelines \\\\n# Manage complex project timelines\\\\n \\\\nAn powerful tool for the PMO & the PMO within all of us\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 2 months ago  \\\\nHive has everything you need to manage large-scale, multi-workstream project plans and with this get-started guide, we'll have your timeline loaded into Hive in no time.\\\\n\\\\nLet's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Where is your project plan now? **\\\\n \\\\n**a) It's in another tool & I'm planning to import it**\\\\n \\\\nGreat, hop over to our Import Guide to review the steps, and come back here once you've imported it\\\\n\\\\n**b) I'm starting from scratch**\\\\n \\\\nOk, let's get you started by creating a New Project (New > Project) with:\\\\n \\\\nTitle\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDue date\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGantt layout\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSections: hold off for now, we will get to that next\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nShared with: we recommend starting with just yourself for now, but our Draft Mode works well if you'd like to add your teammates but not notify them of assignments until you're finished with the plan. \\\\n \\\\n**Tip:** once your project is created, click the configure menu to change the available columns and filters\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Map out the workstreams **\\\\n \\\\n## How does your project naturally 'break down':\\\\n \\\\n**a) By major Stage or Sections of work, with individual steps within these sections owned by specific teams or departments**\\\\n \\\\nIf this is the case, we recommend that you set up Sections within your project to be those major lifecycle stages that everything in your project can be categorized into.\\\\n\\\\nSections are added by going to More > Edit Project > and adding the sections there.\\\\n\\\\nYou can then enter actions into the sections, when you group by section or drag existing actions into your sections:\\\\n\\\\n**b) By Workstream or Department: each team runs their own segment of this overall project and we don't organize into the same lifecycle stage across all work streams. **\\\\n\\\\nIn this case, we recommend that if your Department work streams are more than 30 specific tasks, that these be all labeled the same, and then you view your timeline grouped by Label rather than by Section. Create the labels directly on the action cards using the '+' icon. Here's everything about labels to learn more. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Configure your gantt to work for you **😀\\\\n \\\\n## If any of these would make your life easier - proceed as directed!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like the gantt timeline to auto-adjust my dates: if one date shifts, subsequent dates should be auto-scheduled by Hive** 👉 Turn on Auto-scheduling , or even Strict Auto-scheduling (see link for more).\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like Hive to show my action card as completed if all the subactions are completed, automatically **👉 Toggle on this setting in the Edit Project screen:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like Hive to calculate the start and end date of my parent actions, based on the earliest & latest dates of the subactions** 👉 Toggle on this setting in the Edit Project screen:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like to be able to view all milestones across all projects at once** 👉 Flip those action cards into Milestones and then create your Milestone Report . \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Add your actions into the project**\\\\n\\\\nUse the prompts on the gantt chart to enter your actions one-by-one, or did you know you can copy + paste from a list and Hive will generate separate actions?\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Inviting the team & assigning work**\\\\n \\\\nNow, for the do-ers of your project plan. Head to the Invites section to invite everyone who is responsible to complete a part of this project plan . \\\\n\\\\nRemember, your internal team members within your organization would be regular members, while external parties who may need access to a single project or who are outside of your organization, could be External Users . \\\\n\\\\nWith everyone assigned out their work, it's time to begin! 📈\\\\n\\\\nOnce work is assigned, team members can refer to their My Actions page to see their action and task assignments across all of their projects.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Gain Approval for Deliverables**\\\\n \\\\nIf your deliverables need to go through an internal or external review process, leverage the proofing and approval capabilities in Hive to receive feedback and track approvals.\\\\n\\\\nUpload files for review in the Hive Proofing tool where multiple team members can simultaneously conduct a review, adding comments and markups in real-time.\\\\n\\\\nCreate approval routes that go to multiple users, teams, as well as external approvers (those without Hive accounts).\\\\n\\\\nWhen it's your turn to review, you'll receive a notification and the request for your approval will appear on your My Actions page to easily tracker all of your approval requests.\\\\n\\\\n# **For additional power-ups, we recommend:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nKicking off the project with Running a Great Meeting \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nKeeping track of key dates in Portfolio View \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNoting any major concerns through our Risks & Issues Tracker \\\\n Related Articles Gantt charts Plan & execute company initiatives New this Week in Hive: June 2021 List View: A New Project View in Hive Home View: List View (New)!  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 5063\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Run a Modern Agency\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5099914-run-a-modern-agency-on-hive\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Run a modern agency on Hive | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Run a modern agency on Hive \\\\n# Run a modern agency on Hive\\\\n \\\\nLeverage Hive to enable your Agency workflow from end to end\\\\n Written by Dee Miller Updated over a year ago  \\\\nHive can support every step in your campaign lifecycle from brief to progress reporting. With our step by step guide you can get your campaigns set up ready to go, tracking included. \\\\n\\\\nLet's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: How do your work requests, campaigns or projects begin? Let’s build a seamless work request and briefing system for you.**\\\\n \\\\nWhen initiating projects or campaigns, work generally begins with a brief or request. Create a ** Hive Form ** to capture the request and move away from inconsistent email and duplicate documents. Hive offers you the option of creating an action card in an intake project, ready for triage or creating a project directly from the submission. \\\\n\\\\nTypes of request great for Hive forms:\\\\n \\\\nNew client brief submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative resource or support requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd hoc client requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd Ops Trafficking\\\\n \\\\nHere is an example of a creative resource request and a new campaign brief:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Action card **\\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form is used to collect resource requests for a creative team. The Hive form is creating an action card with the request details for additional resource and landing this in a specific project ready for the triage and assignment:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Project** \\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form collects the briefing information and creates a campaign from a template, ready for the media team to start work. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your Project Navigator and utilise Project Custom Fields for specific campaign information. **\\\\n \\\\nThe project structure must reflect how you organize and execute work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team. \\\\n\\\\nDetermine the structure that’s right for your team by thinking about how the work is structured:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLine of business\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject-based\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign-based\\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create specific guidelines for your Hive users to explain any require naming conventions for your campaigns or projects when applying a template or creating a project. \\\\n\\\\n**Project Custom Fields**\\\\n\\\\nFor custom campaign data that you’d like to track and see displayed on the Project Navigator, project views and included in the Portfolio view, setting up ** Project Custom Fields ** can be incredibly useful. \\\\n\\\\nCampaign data can include:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Budget\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Tier\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient name\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient line of business or product\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSLA details\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nExec Sponsor\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the 'More' menu in the upper right\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create custom field'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType the name of the field you want to add, select the field kind & type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHit 'Save'.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Create a non-campaign or ad-hoc projects to capture tasks outside of your campaigns; support this with a label for easy reporting. **\\\\n \\\\nFrom time to time, tasks and work will occur that is outside of the campaign template. It can help track these for review, assignment or including in your campaign update or QBR with clients.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend creating an Ad Hoc ** project ** where team members can create action cards corresponding to any non-campaign or ad-hoc work requests at a client or channel level. \\\\n\\\\nDoing this will allow you visibility into additional work requests that may be aligned to your organisation’s channels but not specific to any client. At the same time, a client-specific project will give visibility to client-related ad hoc tasks. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create a Hive label that can be applied to all ad-hoc tasks; this will enable you to leverage a Summary view to report all non-campaign tasks across your portfolio. See the next step on how to create labels. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create your labels to categorize work across your campaigns **\\\\n \\\\nWith ** labels **, you can categorize your actions across projects. By creating labels for channels, organization groups, regions or any vital information you would like to group actions and tasks across campaigns or projects, you can easily create a report with a summary view. \\\\n\\\\nLabel data can support:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA Summary View of all work sent to an off-shore hub\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll actions within a specific channel across all campaigns\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll Ad-hoc or non-campaign work-in-progress or complete for a particular client. \\\\n \\\\nJust like an action, you can also create labels with relationships. This gives you more organization and flexibility in categorizing your actions. For example, you may wish to create labels for your channels and group them by region. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Utilize project templates for quick campaign set-up and action templates for processes to support campaign delivery. **\\\\n \\\\n**Project Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** project templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine your campaign plan with the settings, structure and specific steps you need to take in a particular type of campaign or project. Project templates give you the benefit of templating sections, labels, actions, subactions, assignees, custom fields and durations.\\\\n\\\\nRemember that a template has the same qualities as a project, so take advantage and add extras to the template to best represent your campaigns (labels, milestones, etc.) so you can save time once you kick off a live campaign. By including milestones to define KPIs in your template, you will be able to leverage Hive’s Portfolio view and Summary Views to deliver detailed campaign reports based on critical milestones throughout the campaign lifecycle. \\\\n\\\\nProject templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative campaign set-up\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nE2E campaign timelines\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient onboarding projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel Specific campaigns\\\\n \\\\n**Top Tip: **If you have your campaign plan, SLAs or E2E Lifecycle in CSV, it can be quickly uploaded to Hive and ready to go rapidly. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip #2:** Ensure you have a project-level due date on your template that correlates to one of the template’s action due dates. Choose a new due date when applying the template, and all dates will shift according to that date. If no due date is on the template when applied, dates/durations of actions will not carry over. \\\\n\\\\n**How to create a new template**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to the 'Templates' tab on the Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect '+ New Project Template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild the template like you would a project (name, dates, labels, description, attachments, sections)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect who you'd like to share the template with & its permission settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the default layout for the template\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSee the template in the 'Templates' tab\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild out the template as you would a project (you can add actions and subactions and include start and due dates, assignees, labels, etc.) \\\\n\\\\n**Action Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** action templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine the specific steps you need to take in a particular type of task. Applying an action template to an action auto-populates a set of subactions. You can build action templates with labels, assignees, dependencies and ** deadlines **. \\\\n\\\\nAction templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nReports \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative approvals\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nQA rounds\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign briefing \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFinancial reconciliation\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Create your Teams in Hive**\\\\n \\\\nManaging many users is made easy by creating a team in Hive to represent the teams and working groups across your organization. By adding a team to a project every time the team is updated, project members of all projects where the team is a member will be auto-updated. You can add teams to projects, summary views, templates, group chats, comments and tasks within your workspace. This ensures you have the right Hive project members added to the correct campaigns to get to work faster. \\\\n\\\\nHere’s how to create and manage your ** Hive teams **:\\\\n\\\\nTo create a team, go to the \\\\\\\"Manage users\\\\\\\" tab in your workspace settings. You can find this by going to 'Your Profile Dropdown' > 'Manage Users' > 'Teams'. \\\\n \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Teams\\\\\\\" to search existing teams, Edit or Delete existing teams, or create new teams. \\\\n \\\\n**Note:** Only admins or the creator of the team will be able to Edit/Delete teams. \\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"+Create new team\\\\\\\" button will open the following options where you can enter a team name and select workspace members to be part of the team.\\\\n\\\\nTo edit your team click the edit pen icon, and you will be able to amend the membership and name of your team. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n** Summary Views **are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It's handy for managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your client or channel team. A summary view set to table view focused on your client team in Hive or channel label including all projects will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by the due date to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active campaigns to pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Create a Portfolio view to track live campaigns **\\\\n \\\\n** Portfolio View **is the all-in-one place to see the detail set out in Project Navigator combined with a Table View’s flexibility. You have control to build a Portfolio view your way, including Campaigns, Campaign details & Actions; these three building blocks create your portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\nA portfolio view can support live Campaign reporting. When you want to see a picture of all live campaigns for a specific client, including all milestones and project custom fields containing important campaign details, navigate to Portfolio view via your apps menu and start creating your custom portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **You can leverage this view in your status meetings and update the campaign status, description, and other available project information from within the portfolio view. The actions presented enable you to click straight through to the action card and update/review any specific tasks without leaving a portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive and Salesforce Hive 2.0 Template Library Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

Use this guide to get started with setting up your creative workflow in Hive. Let's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Choose your project structure. What is your team type? **\\\\n \\\\n Choose the style closest to you. \\\\n\\\\n## **a) A Marketing & Communications team at a university, institution or organization. **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the Teams / Work streams that you have. For example, you may create work in the following areas and these would each have a project in Hive:\\\\n \\\\nVideo\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEvents\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNewsletters\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBlogs\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPublic Relations: media relations, interviews, press releases\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite content\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite development: Do you maintain more than one domain/site? Make them child projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSocial Media posts: list channels\\\\n\\\\n## **b) A Marketing or Creative team for your company’s product or service **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the major categories of marketing work you produce, for example you may have work in the following categories:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProduct Marketing\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPartnerships\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSales Enablement\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nContent Calendar\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGeneral Marketing (everything else)\\\\n\\\\n## **c) You create deliverables or perform marketing services when requested by your clients**\\\\n \\\\nGreat! Follow-up question here: are you paid for the marketing/creative services? Or, phrased another way - are your clients internal to your organization or are they outside of your organization?\\\\n\\\\n**> If your deliverables are unpaid or clients are internal**\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend that your projects are the **type** of requests you receive from those inside your organization. For instance, let's say you are producing creative marketing materials for real estate agents within your organization. The projects would be the categories of creative work you have, like: Business Cards, New Agent Website, New Listing Postcard, Open House Flyer, Door Hangers. \\\\n\\\\n**> Your deliverables are paid or your clients are external**\\\\n \\\\nCongratulations, you are the traditional 'client based' model for project set-up! We recommend that you create a parent project for each client, and child project is the scope of work, or project sold underneath that client. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Time for a big decision **🤔 - **actions or projects for your work? **\\\\n \\\\nWe are at a fork in the road here! You need to choose if your work is action cards or projects. The rule of thumb is:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project typically takes longer than 30 days or more than 10 major steps, these would usually be **projects. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project is typically shorter than 30 days, or fewer than 10 major steps, the work is usually **action cards. ** \\\\n \\\\nHere's an example of each:\\\\n\\\\n**Action Cards**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, each of the blog articles are on an action card within the Blog Content project. Each blog article has about 5-6 steps and takes a few weeks to complete:\\\\n\\\\n**Projects**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, the website launch has a few components: design, animations, development, QA & user testing and it spans a few months. This makes sense to be its own project.\\\\n\\\\n**Activity: **Create projects in Hive based on the team type & scale recommendation. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Pick your starting point: **how does work usually come to your team?\\\\n \\\\n Pick the option closest to you, but if there are many, it's ok! You can set up each one. \\\\n\\\\n## a) With a request from another team or outside party\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend setting up Hive Forms to manage the intake process. This will standardize the information that your team receives, and eliminate the back-and-forth over email. Once you have your Form created, be sure to share the URL with anyone who makes these requests from you. Putting the link in your email signature is a great idea to promote the new request flow. \\\\n\\\\nReview our Forms Tutorial here and our Video Tutorial here . \\\\n\\\\n## b) With an email request\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you connect Hive Mail, and use the 'Create action from email' option to quickly turn incoming requests into actionable to-dos for your team, slotting them into the correct project and assigning to a team member. \\\\n\\\\n## c) With a weekly, monthly, quarterly planning meeting\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you create a Hive Notes series for this recurring meeting, so you can add a new entry each time the planning meeting occurs, create action items directly form the meeting and put them into your Hive Projects to begin work.\\\\n\\\\nJust start by creating the Hive Note, title it, add an agenda, and share it with attendees of this meeting. The next time this meeting occurs, open the Hive Note & use this for meeting decisions, and action items. \\\\n\\\\n**Activity:** Toggle on Hive Mail, Create Hive Form and/or Create Meeting Note\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Get your supporting apps ready**\\\\n\\\\n## Does your team have creative review cycles? If yes, turn on Proofing & Approvals in Hive Apps\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor internal reviewers, you will be able to route creative work to them as long as they are members of the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor external reviewers - like clients, vendors, partners and others outside of your organization who do not have a Hive license, you will use External Proofing , and you will send them the file using their email address only. \\\\n\\\\n## **Does your team need assistance in Resourcing capacity, keeping track of time or timesheet reporting? If yes, turn on Resourcing, Timesheets so you are ready**\\\\n \\\\nFollow the Workflow Guides for these use cases here::\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Staffing your projects \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Tracking how your team spends time. \\\\n\\\\nActivity: Turn on Proofing & Approvals, Timesheets & Resourcing\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: No time like the present to get your work into Hive**\\\\n\\\\n## Where are your projects and to-dos right now?\\\\n\\\\n**a) You're starting in Hive with a blank slate, not importing from another tool or copying a list of tasks from anywhere!**\\\\n \\\\nNow that you have your projects created, create the action cards with each of the deliverables that your team currently has to do in these projects. Even better, ask another member of the team to assist. \\\\n\\\\n## b) You're importing from another tool\\\\n \\\\nHive can ingest project data from other tools when it's exported in common formats, like CSV and JSON and we have built importers for tools like Basecamp, Trello, Asana and Smartsheet. Follow the import guide here to gather the project work from other tools and import it into Hive. \\\\n\\\\n## c) You have a list of tasks in Excel or other spreadsheet\\\\n \\\\nIf you have a list of tasks in a spreadsheet, or word doc, just copy & paste to put them into Hive. \\\\n\\\\nActivity: Add the action items into Hive using the selected method\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Rally your troops**\\\\n \\\\nNow is a good time to add your team members to the Hive workspace and assign them to their tasks. \\\\n\\\\nYou can invite them & add them to the relevant projects all at once:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: It's go time **🚀\\\\n \\\\nHere is your final checklist to launch now that you have your Projects, Actions, Intake method & supporting Hive Apps (Mail, Notes, Forms) ready to go. \\\\n\\\\n**Final Checklist:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPick your Hive Launch Day & schedule a team meeting for this day\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHost a Hive Launch Day introduction meeting for your team, sharing your screen and showing them how the new creative workflow will happen in Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCelebrate - you're launched! \\\\n Related Articles How to Create an Account in Hive Run successful client engagements Run a modern agency on Hive Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue Introducing Hive University  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"char_count\\\": 7587\\r\\n        },\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          \\\"title\\\": \\\"Run Great Meetings\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755003-run-great-meetings\\\",\\r\\n          \\\"content\\\": \\\"Run great meetings | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Run great meetings \\\\n# Run great meetings\\\\n \\\\nUtilize Hive to meet more efficiently.\\\\n Written by Erin Gouveia Updated over 4 years ago  \\\\nMeetings are at the core of the modern workweek. Use this quick-start guide to get started in Hive and optimize your meeting flow and structure.\\\\n\\\\nDo any of these issues sound familiar?\\\\n \\\\nI don't even know what this meeting is about. Could it just be an email?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I make sure that the meetings we conduct are actually productive with everyone working from home?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I be sure that everyone actually does what they say they'll do before our next sync?\\\\n \\\\nHive has got you covered. In this article, we'll walk through how to optimize your Hive experience to run the best possible meetings and ensure timely and efficient follow-ups. A stellar meeting is a few minutes away.\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Create a Hive Note for your meeting**\\\\n \\\\n**Every great meeting starts with an agenda**. Prepare for the most productive meeting of your life by using Hive Notes to create an agenda and share the note with your teammates. To get started with Hive notes:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on \\\\\\\"Notes\\\\\\\" in the bottom right hand corner of Hive to open the Notes panel.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"New Note\\\\\\\" to create a new note.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssign the Note to a project and any new actions created from the Note will map into that project automatically.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd your agenda items to the note and share with your team by clicking on the \\\\\\\"Share\\\\\\\" button on the note's upper right-hand corner. Additionally, the meeting Note can be sent externally as an email to leadership or clients.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Kick the Meeting Off**\\\\n \\\\nYou've sent around the agenda, and now it's time to kick off the meeting. That's where Hive's Zoom integration comes into play. To ensure that your Zoom account is linked to Hive, complete the following steps:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nVisit \\\\\\\"Hive Apps\\\\\\\" in the left-hand panel navigation section of Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nToggle on the Zoom integration tile, and enter your Zoom details\\\\n \\\\n**Now it's time to start the meeting in Hive, and there are a few ways to do that:**\\\\n\\\\nGo to the messaging group, or direct message, where you want to start a meeting.

A Zoom meeting will automatically be started.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on the Zoom icon on the top right corner of your messaging window.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn the messaging input box, click the + button and select \\\\\\\"Create Zoom Meeting.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Assign Next Steps**\\\\n\\\\nOnce you're in the meeting, you can utilize the Notes collaborative functionality to add notes, next steps, and action items into the Note itself. \\\\n\\\\nTo add an action item into the Note and assign it as a next step, simply select all text that you would like to make a next step and click on the check mark on the bottom left hand corner of the formatting box.\\\\n\\\\nNext, you can assign the next step to someone on your team by clicking on the assignee section and selecting a team member from the dropdown. You can also easily assign a due date.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Link your note to a calendar event **\\\\n \\\\nWant to quickly capture the attendee list and meeting logistics? You can easily do that by syncing your calendar with Hive. \\\\n \\\\n**To enable Hive Calendar, visit the Apps section on the left-hand tool bar and select Hive Apps. Hive Calendar is an available app listed here. Toggle it on, and sign in to your email account and authorize the connection. \\\\n\\\\nOnce enabled, go back to your note and link it to your meeting. Hive will populate all the meeting details for you! \\\\n\\\\n# Step 5: Follow-up with Teammates and turn your ad hoc emails into actions in your project**\\\\n \\\\nNeed to follow-up with teammates or external parties after the meeting? You can do that from inside Hive with Hive Mail.\\\\n\\\\nTo enable Hive Mail , visit the aforementioned Apps section on the left-hand tool bar and select Hive Apps. Hive Mail is an available app listed here. Toggle it on, and sign in to your email account, authorize the connection, and you'll be all set!\\\\n\\\\nThe opportunities with Hive Mail are limitless. In addition to following up on any Notes and next steps assigned, you can also:\\\\n\\\\n**Turn your email into an action card in Hive**\\\\n\\\\nActions you create from an email will be private and assigned to you by default, and the email thread will live in the action card.\\\\n\\\\nTo create an action from an email, click into the email from your Hive Mail inbox, then click the checkmark icon above the message. You’ll then be able to access it from My Actions.\\\\n\\\\n**Link emails to existing actions**\\\\n\\\\nReceive an email that’s relevant to your meeting, or something you’re already working on? You can link emails to existing actions as well! To do so, click into the email from your Hive Mail inbox, then click the link icon above the message. This will embed the email thread into your action card.\\\\n\\\\n**Reply or forward messages right from your action cards**\\\\n\\\\nNo need to hop from action card to inbox. With Hive Mail, you can reply, reply all, or forward messages right from the action card. Circling back has never been easier.\\\\n\\\\n**Send a new email from within an action card**\\\\n\\\\nClick the New Message button to begin a new email chain that will live in the action card.\\\\n\\\\n**Maintain visibility**\\\\n\\\\nEmail threads linked to action cards are dynamic, so they will update with any additional replies that are sent or received.

Hive can seamlessly support your ticketing, triage and work assignment for trafficking and ad hoc work requests. \\\\n\\\\nBelow, we detail the optimal configuration used by our media agency clients around the globe!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Capture all work requests consistently by creating a Hive form.**\\\\n \\\\nTo ensure you can efficiently capture all work requests across your organization and networked agencies, create a ** Hive form **and land these in a defined project for triage, assignment and labelling relevant to your reporting needs. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** For Hive users within your workspace, pin the form for easy access within the New button menu. For Hive users in other workspaces or external individuals to your organization supply them with a handy URL to take them straight to the form. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example, let’s look at this in practice; in this example, a form has been set up to capture data operations requests. When the request is submitted, Hive lands this in an intake project for review where the action card can be assigned to a team member, the due date populated, and work can begin quickly. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your project navigator to house your work queue. **\\\\n \\\\nIt is vital to ensure that the project structure reflects how your team organizes and executes work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team.\\\\n\\\\nDetermine the suitable structure for you and think about how you manage your work queue, assignments, reporting needs, and stakeholder access to the intake projects. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Nesting projects within Hive enables you to manage focused work request queue while leveraging the parent project to look across all nested projects in one view. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Utilize action card custom fields to tailor the action cards to your needs and turn on action card ID.**\\\\n \\\\nThere will be specific details you will need to capture via the request form, which you will want to include in your task details and your reporting. \\\\n\\\\nSet up your form to populate ** action card custom fields ** to ensure that data is presented to your team members and visible in the table view as a column for easy sorting. \\\\n\\\\nBy turning on the action card ID, you can quickly search for the ID in our search function to find specific task or actions details. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create labels to help categorize your actions**\\\\n \\\\nDo you need to report or segment work requests by department, agency, channel or client? When managing your work requests via an intake project, Hive can help you manage your work queue by leveraging labels. \\\\n\\\\nCreate ** labels ** and nest them into functional groupings to support your teams in quickly applying the correct labels. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **Include your labels on your action templates to help support your tracking. The action template can be applied when a request is submitted to ensure that you have all the correct information to hand as soon as the request arrives in your queue. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Create an action template to populate recurring actions, deadlines, labels and assignments**\\\\n \\\\nTo quickly get your teams to work, template recurring tasks that should be followed for each work request with an ** action template .** \\\\n\\\\nThis enables you to add relevant labels, automatically assign work to team members, ensure ** deadlines ** are presented correctly in line with your SLA and provide a consistent workflow for progress reporting and work capacity management. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Set up custom status in the status view to reflect the stages of your workflow**\\\\n \\\\nA custom ** status ** can reflect specific stages in your workflow; on Hold, With Client, or QA are helpful examples of custom status that can be employed to help report on the status of work and communication with project teams. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Connect Hive mail to quickly follow up on form submissions**\\\\n \\\\n** Hive mail ** enables you to attach email strings to existing work requests to support fast follow-ups, confirmations and proactively seeing additional information to help workflow smoothly. You can create an email, reply or forward emails directly from within your action card.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Consider Card priorities level options to help your teams prioritize work requests.**\\\\n \\\\nWant to make sure your teams address high priority items first? Utilize ** Priority Levels ** in Hive and customize it to meet your specific needs. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 9: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n Summary Views are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It is beneficial for traffickers, managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your queue. A summary view set to status view focused on your team in Hive, including all projects, will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by label and priority to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active tasks and pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive Forms Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

As your team works in Hive, each user will have the option to customize their experience, whether that is custom-building their home screen, picking a preferred view in projects, or even determining how they access Hive and the notifications they receive. \\\\n\\\\n**It is important to start simple**. Your team's first impression of a new tool will be made in a few seconds, and your first goal should be to **excite rather than intimidate** with features and processes. \\\\n\\\\nMany teams are comfortable with the technical aspects of Hive following our Hive 101 University course , but the complexity comes as you add your own internal processes. **Make sure to document your decisions and build out process flows** for your team. \\\\n\\\\nIf your end goal is reporting, you will want to build standardized and repeatable processes.\\\\n\\\\nSome questions you may be asked right away could include: \\\\n \\\\nWhat does our organization consider to be a project?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow does a project start? Who manages it as a whole?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWho assigns tasks? What tasks should I expect?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat is expected of me after a task is assigned? How do I work with coworkers?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf more than one person is assigned, who reports progress?\\\\n\\\\n# Before You Begin\\\\n\\\\nThe most important part to have in place before beginning is an understanding of your teams and their workflows. Having workflows defined upfront can help you start fresh or best transition from other tools. \\\\n\\\\nIf you are transitioning from another tool, remember that Hive is an opportunity for a fresh start. Bringing years-old work into a new platform does not add much benefit, and can lock you into old processes that may not work well. Hive's Best Practice is to leave old work in your old tools and to start as fresh as possible. \\\\n\\\\n Build Hive based on your workflows \\\\n\\\\nMany teams choose to do whiteboarding sessions to define their workflows, while others gather feedback from each of their teams. Complexity, such as labeling systems or required data points, can be added later; however, the initial goal when introducing users to a new platform is to demonstrate **how it can help them on a day-to-day basis. **\\\\n\\\\nSome questions to define in advance could be: \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nHow do my teams differ? Does my marketing team have a different process from my communications team? Is there overlap or cross-functional work?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat data do I use now? What data do I expect from my project management tool?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow does work come in now? (i.e, email requests, form submissions, quarterly planning)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow will I organize my team's work?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWho is responsible for managing workloads? Who assigns the work?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow do we plan to review work? What happens during the work phase, and what are my expected outcomes?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat do I expect my team to do on a daily basis in the tool? Does my leadership team interact differently from my project managers? \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen work is finished, how do I plan to report on it? What happens next?\\\\n\\\\nHive differs from word processors and Excel files in the fact that it allows you to define and adhere to repeatable processes. Many teams coming into Hive don't struggle with the tool itself but rather with defining a process that has never been defined before. \\\\n\\\\nCan you draw out how your organization or team manages work from start to finish?\\\\n\\\\n# Core Concepts\\\\n\\\\nAt its core, Hive is made up of just two objects: **Projects **and **Actions. **Many of the Apps and additional pieces of functionality found in Hive, including reporting, center around these concepts. It is important to understand which of the two objects you are talking about when discussing Hive. \\\\n\\\\nEven if you choose to call them something different internally, remember the formal nomenclature here. \\\\n\\\\n## Project\\\\n \\\\nProjects function like folders in the sense that they contain and organize all of your tasks, which are formally known as Action Cards in Hive. Projects are large initiatives or groups of initiatives that can be organized into hierarchies and will contain all the tasks your team needs to do. \\\\n\\\\nThese Projects are visible and accessible on your left-side panel under Project Navigator.\\\\n\\\\nEach project has **unique permissions,** meaning that if a non-Admin user is not added, they do not see it, nor can they access its tasks. As you design your workspace, you will determine what each user can and cannot see. As you add your users, you can even determine whether they have full access rights to create and interact with tasks, or if they can only read them. \\\\n\\\\nEach project also contains an Overview tab where you can define and track: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject Status\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBudgets\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCosts\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nActivity\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAttachments\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRoles (if using Resourcing)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBill / Cost rates (if using Time) \\\\n\\\\nProjects traditionally fall into **two categories** for organizations: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDepartment-level projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nInitiative-level projects\\\\n\\\\nDepartment-level projects are perpetual, meaning they do not have start/end dates, and they constantly ingest work. \\\\n\\\\nInitiative-level projects have set due dates and deadlines. Think of a construction project in this case: all tasks are trending towards an end date, and many may be dependent on each other to begin. \\\\n\\\\nSome examples of these can be seen in the images below. Many teams combine these methods or make their own: \\\\n\\\\n** Department Level Hierarchy: **\\\\n\\\\n** Initiative Level Hierarchy: **\\\\n\\\\nHierarchies, as seen above, help to organize your projects into an easily searchable format. As you build or edit your Project object, changing the Location will determine where the project falls in your hierarchy. T**raditionally, Projects are only created under your hierarchy if they contain 15 or more tasks and run for more than 30 days. **\\\\n\\\\nJust because a user is added to a top level **does not **mean they have access to projects below and vice versa. In the example directly above, clicking Financial Systems Implementations will open a project showing all actions in the 9 projects below. Clicking on New Hampshire Healthcare, however, will only show actions from that specific project. \\\\n\\\\nThe best practice recommendation is to have **no more than 3 layers in your hierarchy**. \\\\n\\\\nMany teams in their first year only have 15-30 projects, but hundreds of action cards. \\\\n\\\\nTo build a hierarchy, when creating or editing a project, select a different location. The name of your workspace will be the default location, but picking an existing project will nest your project underneath. You can find the location bar either by clicking the Project's name when it is open or by clicking the pencil icon when hovering over it in Project Navigator. \\\\n\\\\n## Action Cards\\\\n\\\\nAction Cards, also known as Actions, Cards, or Tasks, are the core element of Hive and the most important object you and your team will be creating. Many long-term teams only have 30 or so projects but thousands of cards. \\\\n\\\\nAction Cards can be as simple or complex as needed. As seen in the example above, I have a relatively in-depth task with multiple assignees and subtasks with subtasks of their own. As a project manager, I add details like labels and dependencies while my employees review and complete their tasks, moving them through various statuses. \\\\n\\\\nAn average assignee will most likely only be viewing what they are being asked to do, moving tasks between statuses, and adding comments/attachments. Project Managers will be looking at the projects holistically and managing labels, task assignment, priority, dependencies, and more. \\\\n\\\\nWhile a project manager may live in Hive, an average employee may only spend 30 minutes a day reviewing their tasks.\\\\n\\\\nAs you bring work into Hive, begin by asking yourself: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIs this complex enough to be a project of its own, or is it just a large task card?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat is my role in Hive? \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat role does my end-user have in all of this?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWho will be creating tasks? Will I be creating all the tasks for my employees upfront, or let them create their own?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat information is needed on my action cards?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I make my action card format repeatable?\\\\n\\\\n### Best Practices Break:\\\\n\\\\nHive is customizable, meaning each user can define how they view the tool. If you want to standardize the experience, make sure to document your decisions \\\\n\\\\nBest practice guidance is to **standardize your approach without restricting your users**, even if multiple departments have different processes. Users respond best to guardrails rather than strict limitations.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow does your organization set up projects?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen are tasks created? What must be included on your tasks? \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nDo we have a project hierarchy? If so, what does it look like?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow am I managing project permissions?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat data is most important to my team?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhat do I expect of my team and how should they interact with tasks?\\\\n\\\\n# Understanding Hierarchy\\\\n \\\\nProject hierarchy functions as a way to group your projects. A three-layer hierarchy has a grandparent-to-child relation as seen below: \\\\n\\\\n• \\\\nProject A (Grandparent Level)\\\\n \\\\nProject B1 (Parent Level)\\\\n \\\\nProject 1C (Child Level) \\\\n\\\\nHive does not contain folders but rather projects inside projects like a nesting doll. Each project is unique in its permissions. Just because a user has access to a Grandparent level does not mean they have access to data in the Parent level and vice versa. \\\\n\\\\nEach of these layers operates as it's own project and contain is own cards. Clicking the Grandparent level, for example, would show you every card in Project A, Project B1, and Project 1C. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, if you click into Project 1C, you will only see tasks made in that project. Hierarchy helps prevent you from having to make multiple clicks when you just want to see all data in one go. Keep these permissions and views in mind when setting up. \\\\n\\\\n# Understanding Projects\\\\n\\\\nAs noted in previous sections, Hive, at its core, is just projects full of tasks. In this section, we will discuss how to best organize and view these tasks. \\\\n\\\\nAt this point, you may have created a project or two, which have a few tabs noting the various views (i.e, List, Status, Table, Gantt) \\\\n\\\\nEach person in your organization learns and works differently. Hive accommodates this by letting teams choose from a large number of project views that users can toggle through to find and interact with their work. \\\\n\\\\nEach Project View comes with its own benefits and many teams choose to standardize their views so users can find their way, no matter where they land using templates. The key takeaways and benefits of the views are listed below and will help you determine which to use for your team. \\\\n\\\\n# Managing the Flow of Work\\\\n\\\\nAs you build your Hive environment, you will also be building and defining the lifecycle of your work. The visual below shows an example of a team's setup for work management. \\\\n\\\\n They define that work comes in through a form submission into a triage project. The team reviews intake and moves the Action Card to an existing project or creates a new project. \\\\n\\\\nAnother team may decide that all work comes in via email and that Project Managers are responsible for inputting it into existing projects. \\\\n\\\\nOnce the projects or actions are in place, the team works toward completion while Management builds reports for monitoring progress. \\\\n\\\\n# Ending Note: User Experience\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, Hive can be as simple or as complex as you would like. It is important, however, to remember your end users. \\\\n\\\\nEnd Users are often the ones juggling multiple tasks on top of updating Hive, so the goal should be making Hive as intuitive and simple as possible. \\\\n\\\\nIf you choose to implement a labeling system, make sure to define it. The same goes for Statuses, Custom Fields, Priorities, and more. \\\\n\\\\nYou may look to save your teams from themselves by restricting the use of the items above. If you have Enterprise Security, consider limiting the creation of Statuses or Labels to Admins under the Enterprise Security settings panel. \\\\n\\\\nKeeping end-user experience in mind will keep your coworkers happy and your environment easy to use. \\\\n\\\\nLooking for more best practice guidance not found here?

Use this guide to get started with setting up your creative workflow in Hive. Let's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Choose your project structure. What is your team type? **\\\\n \\\\n Choose the style closest to you. \\\\n\\\\n## **a) A Marketing & Communications team at a university, institution or organization. **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the Teams / Work streams that you have. For example, you may create work in the following areas and these would each have a project in Hive:\\\\n \\\\nVideo\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEvents\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNewsletters\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBlogs\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPublic Relations: media relations, interviews, press releases\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite content\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite development: Do you maintain more than one domain/site? Make them child projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSocial Media posts: list channels\\\\n\\\\n## **b) A Marketing or Creative team for your company’s product or service **\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend your projects are the major categories of marketing work you produce, for example you may have work in the following categories:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProduct Marketing\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPartnerships\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSales Enablement\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWebsite\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nContent Calendar\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGeneral Marketing (everything else)\\\\n\\\\n## **c) You create deliverables or perform marketing services when requested by your clients**\\\\n \\\\nGreat! Follow-up question here: are you paid for the marketing/creative services? Or, phrased another way - are your clients internal to your organization or are they outside of your organization?\\\\n\\\\n**> If your deliverables are unpaid or clients are internal**\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend that your projects are the **type** of requests you receive from those inside your organization. For instance, let's say you are producing creative marketing materials for real estate agents within your organization. The projects would be the categories of creative work you have, like: Business Cards, New Agent Website, New Listing Postcard, Open House Flyer, Door Hangers. \\\\n\\\\n**> Your deliverables are paid or your clients are external**\\\\n \\\\nCongratulations, you are the traditional 'client based' model for project set-up! We recommend that you create a parent project for each client, and child project is the scope of work, or project sold underneath that client. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Time for a big decision **🤔 - **actions or projects for your work? **\\\\n \\\\nWe are at a fork in the road here! You need to choose if your work is action cards or projects. The rule of thumb is:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project typically takes longer than 30 days or more than 10 major steps, these would usually be **projects. **\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIf your project is typically shorter than 30 days, or fewer than 10 major steps, the work is usually **action cards. ** \\\\n \\\\nHere's an example of each:\\\\n\\\\n**Action Cards**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, each of the blog articles are on an action card within the Blog Content project. Each blog article has about 5-6 steps and takes a few weeks to complete:\\\\n\\\\n**Projects**\\\\n \\\\nIn the below example, the website launch has a few components: design, animations, development, QA & user testing and it spans a few months. This makes sense to be its own project.\\\\n\\\\n**Activity: **Create projects in Hive based on the team type & scale recommendation. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Pick your starting point: **how does work usually come to your team?\\\\n \\\\n Pick the option closest to you, but if there are many, it's ok! You can set up each one. \\\\n\\\\n## a) With a request from another team or outside party\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend setting up Hive Forms to manage the intake process. This will standardize the information that your team receives, and eliminate the back-and-forth over email. Once you have your Form created, be sure to share the URL with anyone who makes these requests from you. Putting the link in your email signature is a great idea to promote the new request flow. \\\\n\\\\nReview our Forms Tutorial here and our Video Tutorial here . \\\\n\\\\n## b) With an email request\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you connect Hive Mail, and use the 'Create action from email' option to quickly turn incoming requests into actionable to-dos for your team, slotting them into the correct project and assigning to a team member. \\\\n\\\\n## c) With a weekly, monthly, quarterly planning meeting\\\\n \\\\nWe recommend you create a Hive Notes series for this recurring meeting, so you can add a new entry each time the planning meeting occurs, create action items directly form the meeting and put them into your Hive Projects to begin work.\\\\n\\\\nJust start by creating the Hive Note, title it, add an agenda, and share it with attendees of this meeting. The next time this meeting occurs, open the Hive Note & use this for meeting decisions, and action items. \\\\n\\\\n**Activity:** Toggle on Hive Mail, Create Hive Form and/or Create Meeting Note\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Get your supporting apps ready**\\\\n\\\\n## Does your team have creative review cycles? If yes, turn on Proofing & Approvals in Hive Apps\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor internal reviewers, you will be able to route creative work to them as long as they are members of the project. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFor external reviewers - like clients, vendors, partners and others outside of your organization who do not have a Hive license, you will use External Proofing , and you will send them the file using their email address only. \\\\n\\\\n## **Does your team need assistance in Resourcing capacity, keeping track of time or timesheet reporting? If yes, turn on Resourcing, Timesheets so you are ready**\\\\n \\\\nFollow the Workflow Guides for these use cases here::\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Staffing your projects \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n Tracking how your team spends time. \\\\n\\\\nActivity: Turn on Proofing & Approvals, Timesheets & Resourcing\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: No time like the present to get your work into Hive**\\\\n\\\\n## Where are your projects and to-dos right now?\\\\n\\\\n**a) You're starting in Hive with a blank slate, not importing from another tool or copying a list of tasks from anywhere!**\\\\n \\\\nNow that you have your projects created, create the action cards with each of the deliverables that your team currently has to do in these projects. Even better, ask another member of the team to assist. \\\\n\\\\n## b) You're importing from another tool\\\\n \\\\nHive can ingest project data from other tools when it's exported in common formats, like CSV and JSON and we have built importers for tools like Basecamp, Trello, Asana and Smartsheet. Follow the import guide here to gather the project work from other tools and import it into Hive. \\\\n\\\\n## c) You have a list of tasks in Excel or other spreadsheet\\\\n \\\\nIf you have a list of tasks in a spreadsheet, or word doc, just copy & paste to put them into Hive. \\\\n\\\\nActivity: Add the action items into Hive using the selected method\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Rally your troops**\\\\n \\\\nNow is a good time to add your team members to the Hive workspace and assign them to their tasks. \\\\n\\\\nYou can invite them & add them to the relevant projects all at once:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: It's go time **🚀\\\\n \\\\nHere is your final checklist to launch now that you have your Projects, Actions, Intake method & supporting Hive Apps (Mail, Notes, Forms) ready to go. \\\\n\\\\n**Final Checklist:**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nPick your Hive Launch Day & schedule a team meeting for this day\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHost a Hive Launch Day introduction meeting for your team, sharing your screen and showing them how the new creative workflow will happen in Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCelebrate - you're launched! \\\\n Related Articles How to Create an Account in Hive Run successful client engagements Run a modern agency on Hive Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue Introducing Hive University  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password?

Create the labels directly on the action cards using the '+' icon. Here's everything about labels to learn more. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Configure your gantt to work for you **😀\\\\n \\\\n## If any of these would make your life easier - proceed as directed!\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like the gantt timeline to auto-adjust my dates: if one date shifts, subsequent dates should be auto-scheduled by Hive** 👉 Turn on Auto-scheduling , or even Strict Auto-scheduling (see link for more).\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like Hive to show my action card as completed if all the subactions are completed, automatically **👉 Toggle on this setting in the Edit Project screen:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like Hive to calculate the start and end date of my parent actions, based on the earliest & latest dates of the subactions** 👉 Toggle on this setting in the Edit Project screen:\\\\n\\\\n• \\\\n**I'd like to be able to view all milestones across all projects at once** 👉 Flip those action cards into Milestones and then create your Milestone Report . \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Add your actions into the project**\\\\n\\\\nUse the prompts on the gantt chart to enter your actions one-by-one, or did you know you can copy + paste from a list and Hive will generate separate actions?\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Inviting the team & assigning work**\\\\n \\\\nNow, for the do-ers of your project plan.

With our step by step guide you can get your campaigns set up ready to go, tracking included. \\\\n\\\\nLet's get started!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: How do your work requests, campaigns or projects begin? Let’s build a seamless work request and briefing system for you.**\\\\n \\\\nWhen initiating projects or campaigns, work generally begins with a brief or request. Create a ** Hive Form ** to capture the request and move away from inconsistent email and duplicate documents. Hive offers you the option of creating an action card in an intake project, ready for triage or creating a project directly from the submission. \\\\n\\\\nTypes of request great for Hive forms:\\\\n \\\\nNew client brief submission\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative resource or support requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd hoc client requests\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAd Ops Trafficking\\\\n \\\\nHere is an example of a creative resource request and a new campaign brief:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Action card **\\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form is used to collect resource requests for a creative team. The Hive form is creating an action card with the request details for additional resource and landing this in a specific project ready for the triage and assignment:\\\\n\\\\n**Hive Form to Project** \\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, the Hive Form collects the briefing information and creates a campaign from a template, ready for the media team to start work. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your Project Navigator and utilise Project Custom Fields for specific campaign information. **\\\\n \\\\nThe project structure must reflect how you organize and execute work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team. \\\\n\\\\nDetermine the structure that’s right for your team by thinking about how the work is structured:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nLine of business\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nProject-based\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign-based\\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create specific guidelines for your Hive users to explain any require naming conventions for your campaigns or projects when applying a template or creating a project. \\\\n\\\\n**Project Custom Fields**\\\\n\\\\nFor custom campaign data that you’d like to track and see displayed on the Project Navigator, project views and included in the Portfolio view, setting up ** Project Custom Fields ** can be incredibly useful. \\\\n\\\\nCampaign data can include:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Budget\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign Tier\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient name\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient line of business or product\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSLA details\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nExec Sponsor\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to set one up:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the project where you want to add a custom field\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the 'More' menu in the upper right\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create custom field'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType the name of the field you want to add, select the field kind & type\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHit 'Save'.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Create a non-campaign or ad-hoc projects to capture tasks outside of your campaigns; support this with a label for easy reporting. **\\\\n \\\\nFrom time to time, tasks and work will occur that is outside of the campaign template. It can help track these for review, assignment or including in your campaign update or QBR with clients.\\\\n\\\\nWe recommend creating an Ad Hoc ** project ** where team members can create action cards corresponding to any non-campaign or ad-hoc work requests at a client or channel level. \\\\n\\\\nDoing this will allow you visibility into additional work requests that may be aligned to your organisation’s channels but not specific to any client. At the same time, a client-specific project will give visibility to client-related ad hoc tasks. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Create a Hive label that can be applied to all ad-hoc tasks; this will enable you to leverage a Summary view to report all non-campaign tasks across your portfolio. See the next step on how to create labels. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create your labels to categorize work across your campaigns **\\\\n \\\\nWith ** labels **, you can categorize your actions across projects. By creating labels for channels, organization groups, regions or any vital information you would like to group actions and tasks across campaigns or projects, you can easily create a report with a summary view. \\\\n\\\\nLabel data can support:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nA Summary View of all work sent to an off-shore hub\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll actions within a specific channel across all campaigns\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAll Ad-hoc or non-campaign work-in-progress or complete for a particular client. \\\\n \\\\nJust like an action, you can also create labels with relationships. This gives you more organization and flexibility in categorizing your actions. For example, you may wish to create labels for your channels and group them by region. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Utilize project templates for quick campaign set-up and action templates for processes to support campaign delivery. **\\\\n \\\\n**Project Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** project templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine your campaign plan with the settings, structure and specific steps you need to take in a particular type of campaign or project. Project templates give you the benefit of templating sections, labels, actions, subactions, assignees, custom fields and durations.\\\\n\\\\nRemember that a template has the same qualities as a project, so take advantage and add extras to the template to best represent your campaigns (labels, milestones, etc.) so you can save time once you kick off a live campaign. By including milestones to define KPIs in your template, you will be able to leverage Hive’s Portfolio view and Summary Views to deliver detailed campaign reports based on critical milestones throughout the campaign lifecycle. \\\\n\\\\nProject templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative campaign set-up\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nE2E campaign timelines\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClient onboarding projects\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nChannel Specific campaigns\\\\n \\\\n**Top Tip: **If you have your campaign plan, SLAs or E2E Lifecycle in CSV, it can be quickly uploaded to Hive and ready to go rapidly. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip #2:** Ensure you have a project-level due date on your template that correlates to one of the template’s action due dates. Choose a new due date when applying the template, and all dates will shift according to that date. If no due date is on the template when applied, dates/durations of actions will not carry over. \\\\n\\\\n**How to create a new template**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nNavigate to the 'Templates' tab on the Project Navigator\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect '+ New Project Template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild the template like you would a project (name, dates, labels, description, attachments, sections)\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect who you'd like to share the template with & its permission settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the default layout for the template\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect 'Create template'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSee the template in the 'Templates' tab\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nBuild out the template as you would a project (you can add actions and subactions and include start and due dates, assignees, labels, etc.) \\\\n\\\\n**Action Templates**\\\\n\\\\nCreating ** action templates ** speeds up your work by allowing you to predefine the specific steps you need to take in a particular type of task. Applying an action template to an action auto-populates a set of subactions. You can build action templates with labels, assignees, dependencies and ** deadlines **. \\\\n\\\\nAction templates are great for: \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nReports \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCreative approvals\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nQA rounds\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCampaign briefing \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nFinancial reconciliation\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Create your Teams in Hive**\\\\n \\\\nManaging many users is made easy by creating a team in Hive to represent the teams and working groups across your organization. By adding a team to a project every time the team is updated, project members of all projects where the team is a member will be auto-updated. You can add teams to projects, summary views, templates, group chats, comments and tasks within your workspace. This ensures you have the right Hive project members added to the correct campaigns to get to work faster. \\\\n\\\\nHere’s how to create and manage your ** Hive teams **:\\\\n\\\\nTo create a team, go to the \\\\\\\"Manage users\\\\\\\" tab in your workspace settings. You can find this by going to 'Your Profile Dropdown' > 'Manage Users' > 'Teams'. \\\\n \\\\nSelect \\\\\\\"Teams\\\\\\\" to search existing teams, Edit or Delete existing teams, or create new teams. \\\\n \\\\n**Note:** Only admins or the creator of the team will be able to Edit/Delete teams. \\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"+Create new team\\\\\\\" button will open the following options where you can enter a team name and select workspace members to be part of the team.\\\\n\\\\nTo edit your team click the edit pen icon, and you will be able to amend the membership and name of your team. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n** Summary Views **are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It's handy for managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your client or channel team. A summary view set to table view focused on your client team in Hive or channel label including all projects will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by the due date to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active campaigns to pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Create a Portfolio view to track live campaigns **\\\\n \\\\n** Portfolio View **is the all-in-one place to see the detail set out in Project Navigator combined with a Table View’s flexibility. You have control to build a Portfolio view your way, including Campaigns, Campaign details & Actions; these three building blocks create your portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\nA portfolio view can support live Campaign reporting. When you want to see a picture of all live campaigns for a specific client, including all milestones and project custom fields containing important campaign details, navigate to Portfolio view via your apps menu and start creating your custom portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **You can leverage this view in your status meetings and update the campaign status, description, and other available project information from within the portfolio view. The actions presented enable you to click straight through to the action card and update/review any specific tasks without leaving a portfolio view. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive and Salesforce Hive 2.0 Template Library Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.

Use this quick-start guide to get started in Hive and optimize your meeting flow and structure.\\\\n\\\\nDo any of these issues sound familiar?\\\\n \\\\nI don't even know what this meeting is about. Could it just be an email?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I make sure that the meetings we conduct are actually productive with everyone working from home?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow can I be sure that everyone actually does what they say they'll do before our next sync?\\\\n \\\\nHive has got you covered. In this article, we'll walk through how to optimize your Hive experience to run the best possible meetings and ensure timely and efficient follow-ups. A stellar meeting is a few minutes away.\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Create a Hive Note for your meeting**\\\\n \\\\n**Every great meeting starts with an agenda**. Prepare for the most productive meeting of your life by using Hive Notes to create an agenda and share the note with your teammates. To get started with Hive notes:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on \\\\\\\"Notes\\\\\\\" in the bottom right hand corner of Hive to open the Notes panel.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick \\\\\\\"New Note\\\\\\\" to create a new note.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAssign the Note to a project and any new actions created from the Note will map into that project automatically.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd your agenda items to the note and share with your team by clicking on the \\\\\\\"Share\\\\\\\" button on the note's upper right-hand corner. Additionally, the meeting Note can be sent externally as an email to leadership or clients.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Kick the Meeting Off**\\\\n \\\\nYou've sent around the agenda, and now it's time to kick off the meeting. That's where Hive's Zoom integration comes into play. To ensure that your Zoom account is linked to Hive, complete the following steps:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nVisit \\\\\\\"Hive Apps\\\\\\\" in the left-hand panel navigation section of Hive\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nToggle on the Zoom integration tile, and enter your Zoom details\\\\n \\\\n**Now it's time to start the meeting in Hive, and there are a few ways to do that:**\\\\n\\\\nGo to the messaging group, or direct message, where you want to start a meeting. From there, you can start a meeting in a few ways:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nType \\\\\\\"/zoom\\\\\\\" in the group or direct message. A Zoom meeting will automatically be started.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nClick on the Zoom icon on the top right corner of your messaging window.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nIn the messaging input box, click the + button and select \\\\\\\"Create Zoom Meeting.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Assign Next Steps**\\\\n\\\\nOnce you're in the meeting, you can utilize the Notes collaborative functionality to add notes, next steps, and action items into the Note itself. \\\\n\\\\nTo add an action item into the Note and assign it as a next step, simply select all text that you would like to make a next step and click on the check mark on the bottom left hand corner of the formatting box.\\\\n\\\\nNext, you can assign the next step to someone on your team by clicking on the assignee section and selecting a team member from the dropdown. You can also easily assign a due date.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Link your note to a calendar event **\\\\n \\\\nWant to quickly capture the attendee list and meeting logistics? You can easily do that by syncing your calendar with Hive. \\\\n \\\\n**To enable Hive Calendar, visit the Apps section on the left-hand tool bar and select Hive Apps. Hive Calendar is an available app listed here. Toggle it on, and sign in to your email account and authorize the connection. \\\\n\\\\nOnce enabled, go back to your note and link it to your meeting. Hive will populate all the meeting details for you! \\\\n\\\\n# Step 5: Follow-up with Teammates and turn your ad hoc emails into actions in your project**\\\\n \\\\nNeed to follow-up with teammates or external parties after the meeting? You can do that from inside Hive with Hive Mail.\\\\n\\\\nTo enable Hive Mail , visit the aforementioned Apps section on the left-hand tool bar and select Hive Apps. Hive Mail is an available app listed here. Toggle it on, and sign in to your email account, authorize the connection, and you'll be all set!\\\\n\\\\nThe opportunities with Hive Mail are limitless.

You’ll then be able to access it from My Actions.\\\\n\\\\n**Link emails to existing actions**\\\\n\\\\nReceive an email that’s relevant to your meeting, or something you’re already working on? You can link emails to existing actions as well! To do so, click into the email from your Hive Mail inbox, then click the link icon above the message. This will embed the email thread into your action card.\\\\n\\\\n**Reply or forward messages right from your action cards**\\\\n\\\\nNo need to hop from action card to inbox. With Hive Mail, you can reply, reply all, or forward messages right from the action card.

We're going to walk through how to configure Hive's Resourcing module, so you can start uncovering these insights and drive some change in your organization!\\\\n\\\\n Note:** It's preferable that you're starting with your projects already created & entered in Hive, so check out one of our other Workflow guides if you haven't completed that step yet! \\\\n\\\\n# ** Step 1: Turn on Resourcing in Hive Apps**\\\\n\\\\nHead to Apps on the left-hand panel and toggle on Resourcing:\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Pick your Resourcing \\\\\\\"Zoom Level\\\\\\\" **🔎 :** where do you currently estimate effort for your team's work?**\\\\n \\\\n## Pick which is closest to what your team does.\\\\n\\\\n## a) It's at the task-level - we estimate how long each step in our plan will take, which allows us to be granular.\\\\n \\\\nIn this case, we recommend that Timetracking is also toggled on in Hive Apps so that you can enter estimates onto action cards within your plans. \\\\n\\\\nTo reiterate, task-based estimates are added per person, per action card\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates are usually more granular and are always attached to specific actionable to-dos. Remember actions are things that people can \\\\\\\"do\\\\\\\" & check off their list\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThe estimates will follow the project plan, so shifts in the project plan automatically update your Resourcing view\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nEstimates appear as guidance for individuals about their allocated time, when they look at My Actions view.\\\\n \\\\nGo to each action card where you want to enter time, and use the Estimates section to add the time. Remember to add the due date to the card, so it will be visible within Resourcing. \\\\n\\\\n**b) If at the Project-level, you will be using resource assignments: estimates are added per person, at the project level.**\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThis is typically used as broader \\\\\\\"buckets\\\\\\\" of time for blocking out people's availability in assignments when the exact tasks are not known or the level of granularity is too much to maintain for the team\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nResource assignments do not appear in My Actions View - they are not things to be 'completed'\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nThey do not move with project plan updates\\\\n\\\\nGo to the Resourcing View, and double-click onto the individual's line where you want to add the estimate. \\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the project\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdjust the effort\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nAdd the dates\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nRemember to confirm! (This sends the user a notification)\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Do you resource by team? **\\\\n \\\\n## Do your team members have assigned teams that you may want to quickly filter to - i.e., show me the Design Team's workload?\\\\n\\\\n**Yes? ** Create teams & set all employees' teams in the Workspace Setting: click on your profile icon, click Settings, navigate to Teams, click the blue \\\\\\\"Create new team\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Does your team have specific roles or special skills?**\\\\n \\\\na) Yes! Great, you can go to the Resourcing Setting, go to People, search for a user, click on their name, and then you'll be able to update the user role or User Tag.\\\\n\\\\nIf you require a user’s role to be modified for a particular project, the Admin or Project Owner can make the necessary adjustments on the Overview page.\\\\n\\\\nb) No, teams is specific enough for my resourcing view. --> No action needed!\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Do you need to allocate time before you know who can take on the work?**\\\\n \\\\nIf so, Placeholders are going to assist in making this possible. A placeholder, like \\\\\\\"Copywriter\\\\\\\" for instance, allows you to assign a task without knowing yet who on your team will take the work. You can see allocations to Placeholders in Resourcing so you know how much work is coming up for a particular team. \\\\n\\\\nTo create Placeholders, head to the More > Settings menu in Resourcing and add from there. \\\\n\\\\nThen, on your projects, select the Placeholders you want to include in that project in the Edit Project Screen:\\\\n\\\\nThen finally, assign the action card to the Placeholder Assignee:\\\\n \\\\n *Note: You can also assign an action card to a Placeholder and a User to an action card! \\\\n\\\\nIf the Estimated time you added exceeds the available hours of the team member who is assigned to this action, you'll be notified that \\\\\\\"This change exceeds <User> availability on <Date>\\\\\\\". User availability is determined based on the user’s Work week hours. This section can be accessed by going to Resourcing > User Profile.\\\\n\\\\nIf the user’s workweek hours are not provided, Hive will utilize the Threshold value specified in the Resourcing settings. In the absence of a Threshold value, Hive will default to the Working day value.\\\\n\\\\n# **Finally, you're ready for the big step **💪 :** Notifying your team of the new resourcing process**\\\\n \\\\nWe think it's best to call a Team Meeting with anyone involved or impacted by the Resourcing workflow (you can always use our guide for Running Great Meetings ). \\\\n\\\\nMake sure you agree on the motions of resourcing your team:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWill you add Estimates & using Placeholders in your Project Templates so you don't need to reinvent the wheel when a new project kicks-off\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nHow will you deal with overallocation (will people work more hours, or will timelines shift, or will more headcount be required)?\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nCan everyone see Resourcing, or do you need to restrict visibility for any reason? Review that setting here . \\\\n\\\\n Staffing your team appropriately is both art & science, and we're here to provide the platform to host these great masterpieces! \\\\n Related Articles Time Tracking Quick-Start Guide Using placeholders Adding placeholder resources to projects Resourcing 2.0 - Comprehensive Overview  😞 😐 😃 \\\\n• Sign In \\\\n• Forgot Password? \\\\n• API \\\\n• \\\\n•\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"mapped_articles\\\": [\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4752748-plan-execute-company-initiatives\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755427-manage-complex-project-timelines\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5099914-run-a-modern-agency-on-hive\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4684961-produce-creative-work\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/4755003-run-great-meetings\\\",\\r\\n        \\\"https://help.hive.com/en/articles/5100289-supercharge-your-ad-ops-work-queue\\\"\\r\\n      ]\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    {\\r\\n      \\\"course_id\\\": \\\"uc_adops\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Supercharge Ad Ops\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://university.hive.com/uc-adops\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"duration\\\": \\\"25 min\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"level\\\": \\\"Intermediate\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"use_case_guide\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"description\\\": \\\"Work queue management, intake, labels, time tracking for ad operations\\\",\\r\\n      \\\"full_guide_content\\\": \\\"Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue | Hive Help \\\\n• **     Use Cases Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue \\\\n# Supercharge your Ad Ops work queue\\\\n \\\\nUse Hive forms and action templates to capture and assign a high volume of work requests easily.\\\\n Written by Dee Miller Updated over 4 years ago  \\\\nMedia Operations and Advertising Operations teams deal with a considerable number of tasks originating from various sources across their agency or network, and it can get complicated quickly. Hive can seamlessly support your ticketing, triage and work assignment for trafficking and ad hoc work requests. \\\\n\\\\nBelow, we detail the optimal configuration used by our media agency clients around the globe!\\\\n\\\\n# Step 1: Capture all work requests consistently by creating a Hive form.**\\\\n \\\\nTo ensure you can efficiently capture all work requests across your organization and networked agencies, create a ** Hive form **and land these in a defined project for triage, assignment and labelling relevant to your reporting needs. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** For Hive users within your workspace, pin the form for easy access within the New button menu. For Hive users in other workspaces or external individuals to your organization supply them with a handy URL to take them straight to the form. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example, let’s look at this in practice; in this example, a form has been set up to capture data operations requests. When the request is submitted, Hive lands this in an intake project for review where the action card can be assigned to a team member, the due date populated, and work can begin quickly. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 2: Set up your project navigator to house your work queue. **\\\\n \\\\nIt is vital to ensure that the project structure reflects how your team organizes and executes work. Hive provides you with the flexibility to create a ** project hierarchy **that’s right for you and your team.\\\\n\\\\nDetermine the suitable structure for you and think about how you manage your work queue, assignments, reporting needs, and stakeholder access to the intake projects. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip:** Nesting projects within Hive enables you to manage focused work request queue while leveraging the parent project to look across all nested projects in one view. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 3: Utilize action card custom fields to tailor the action cards to your needs and turn on action card ID.**\\\\n \\\\nThere will be specific details you will need to capture via the request form, which you will want to include in your task details and your reporting. \\\\n\\\\nSet up your form to populate ** action card custom fields ** to ensure that data is presented to your team members and visible in the table view as a column for easy sorting. \\\\n\\\\nBy turning on the action card ID, you can quickly search for the ID in our search function to find specific task or actions details. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 4: Create labels to help categorize your actions**\\\\n \\\\nDo you need to report or segment work requests by department, agency, channel or client? When managing your work requests via an intake project, Hive can help you manage your work queue by leveraging labels. \\\\n\\\\nCreate ** labels ** and nest them into functional groupings to support your teams in quickly applying the correct labels. \\\\n\\\\n**Top Tip: **Include your labels on your action templates to help support your tracking. The action template can be applied when a request is submitted to ensure that you have all the correct information to hand as soon as the request arrives in your queue. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how to create your labels:\\\\n \\\\nNavigate to your profile menu, and click on Workspace settings\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nGo to the “Labels” tab and create a new label\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nSelect the parent label for any labels which you wish to nest under a parent label\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 5: Create an action template to populate recurring actions, deadlines, labels and assignments**\\\\n \\\\nTo quickly get your teams to work, template recurring tasks that should be followed for each work request with an ** action template .** \\\\n\\\\nThis enables you to add relevant labels, automatically assign work to team members, ensure ** deadlines ** are presented correctly in line with your SLA and provide a consistent workflow for progress reporting and work capacity management. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 6: Set up custom status in the status view to reflect the stages of your workflow**\\\\n \\\\nA custom ** status ** can reflect specific stages in your workflow; on Hold, With Client, or QA are helpful examples of custom status that can be employed to help report on the status of work and communication with project teams. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 7: Connect Hive mail to quickly follow up on form submissions**\\\\n \\\\n** Hive mail ** enables you to attach email strings to existing work requests to support fast follow-ups, confirmations and proactively seeing additional information to help workflow smoothly. You can create an email, reply or forward emails directly from within your action card.\\\\n\\\\n# **Step 8: Consider Card priorities level options to help your teams prioritize work requests.**\\\\n \\\\nWant to make sure your teams address high priority items first? Utilize ** Priority Levels ** in Hive and customize it to meet your specific needs. \\\\n\\\\n# **Step 9: Build a Summary View for teamwork assignments & Status.**\\\\n \\\\n Summary Views are a great way to combine several projects into one view. It is beneficial for traffickers, managers and those who want to take a look at the bigger picture across the team. \\\\n\\\\nExamples of leveraging summary views:\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen you have a team status meeting and need to pull a report of all work within your queue. A summary view set to status view focused on your team in Hive, including all projects, will return a detailed report of all tasks for your status meeting. This view can also be sorted by label and priority to identify the most pressing tasks.\\\\n \\\\n• \\\\nWhen working with your team to assess workload, use a summary view set to team view showing all active tasks and pull a report across your team to identify who has the capacity to help support when a team member has too much work on deadline. \\\\n\\\\n Related Articles Hive Forms Plan & execute company initiatives Run a modern agency on Hive How to approach Epics with Hive Agile.
